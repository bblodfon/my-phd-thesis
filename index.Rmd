**Keywords:**  
*curation/knowledge management, VSM, causal statements, DrugLogics pipeline 
(model parameterization/calibration and prediction of synergistic drug combinations), 
biomarker analysis, synergy assesement*

Right now we are in a preliminary stage, so in order to make a plan that I can
follow for the rest of the PhD, I have to make my best to *combine the technologies
within our group, the expertise from other people and of course my own work* to
produce (research) results. In the end I will need some papers with me as first 
author and a coherent story to tell, and this will be the culmination of my work 
at NTNU.

Chapters are currently split as:

- Work I have done (see [Chapter 1](#work)) 
- Future plans (see [Chapter 2](#plans)). This includes the list of 
proposed papers for my PhD.
- For more experimental/future ideas see [Chapter 3](#ideas).
