# Structure {-}

Chapters are currently split as:

- Work I have done (see [Chapter 1](#work)) 
- Future plans (see [Chapter 2](#plans)). This includes the list of papers for my PhD.
- For more experimental/future ideas see [Chapter 3](#ideas).

### Keywords {-}

*curation/knowledge management, VSM, causal statements, DrugLogics pipeline 
(model parameterization/calibration and prediction of synergistic drug combinations), 
biomarker analysis, synergy assessment*

### PhD Plan chart {-}

In my effort to *combine the technologies within our group, the expertise from other people and of course my own work* to produce (research) results, I have come with the following action plan + papers for an organicly grown thesis:

Literature => Curation => Causal Statements => Models => Predicting Synergies => Finding mechanisms

Why and when?
