# Intro {-}

Chapters are currently split as:

- Work I have done (see [Chapter 1](#work)) 
- Future plans (see [Chapter 2](#papers)). This includes the list of papers for my PhD.
- For more experimental/future ideas see [Chapter 3](#ideas).
- Various text that I have been writing here and there [Chapter 4](#text).

### Introduction {-}

Is there a plan actually?

Literature => Curation => Causal Statements => Models => Predicting Synergies => Finding mechanisms/optimizing performance

### About the title {-}

Original title in my PhD plan was: 

**Software implementations allowing new approaches toward data analysis, modeling and integration / curation of biological knowledge for Systems Medicine**

I am thinking that we may need to change it a little bit. 
The reason: it started as something very general and abstract and in the end it seems I did some specific things but in various areas which still remain abstractly connected. 
Alternative titles that I am thinking of currently:

- How to Engineer your way through a Systems Medicine PhD thesis!
- Software Engineering enables optimized Systems Medicine approaches toward data analysis, modeling and curation of biological knowledge

And some for fun:

- Neural transformations and hydrothermal aperture in deterministic radar hydrothermal decompositions
- Hydro-thermal applications and kinematic eigenvalues in exponential reliability inflationary amplitudes
- Non-isothermal trellises of time-varying transmembrane and quantitative poly-and-mono-phonemes in locally capacitive hypermultiplets

**To be decided what will be the end title!**

### Keywords {-}

*curation/knowledge management, VSM, causal statements, DrugLogics pipeline 
(model parameterization/calibration and prediction of synergistic drug combinations, performance optimization), biomarker analysis, synergy assessment*
