  I would take him kindly and forgivingly by the hand and lead him
  to a quiet place and kill him."

$f = a$

\begin{equation} 
  f=a
  (\#eq:binom)
\end{equation} 


See Equation \@ref(eq:binom).

```{theorem, name="Pythagorean theorem", label = "pyth"}
For a right triangle, if $c$ denotes the length of the hypotenuse
and $a$ and $b$ denote the lengths of the other two sides, we have
$$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$$
```

See Theorem \@ref(thm:pyth).

```{definition, pyth-def, name="Pythagorean theorem"}
For a right triangle, if $c$ denotes the length of the hypotenuse
and $a$ and $b$ denote the lengths of the other two sides, we have
$$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$$
```

See Definition \@ref(def:pyth-def).

## Figures

A normal paragraph.

(ref:foo) A scatterplot of the data `cars` using **base** R graphics. 

```{r foo, fig.cap='(ref:foo)', echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)  # a scatterplot
```

```{r question, fig.cap="A Big Question", echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='45%'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/questions.jpeg")
```

See Figure \@ref(fig:question)!

## Tables

```{r table1, echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(
  head(mtcars[, 1:8], 5), booktabs = TRUE,
  caption = 'A table of the first 5 rows of the mtcars data.'
)
```

See Table \@ref(tab:table1)

```{r exam}
DT::datatable(iris)
```
