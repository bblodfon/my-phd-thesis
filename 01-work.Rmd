# PhD work {#work}

This is a summary of all the work that I have done in my PhD until now. 
(mainly it's about software implementations related to the core technologies 
within the group). There is going to be at least a mention of these in the 
thesis text.

Note though that not all of these will be part of the main thesis (maybe include the 
rest in a section like 'Funny PhD side-quests').

## Pipeline

- Lots of refactoring to increase the readability, maintainability and 
extendability of the source code (complete restructure of classes, addition of
others)
- Bug fixing
- Enable maven packaging for easier source compilation, testing, 
installation, management and executing of the code
- Added tests to modules `gitsbe` and `drabme` using JUnit5, mockito and assertJ libraries
- Source code documentation + proper README files on `gitsbe`, `drabme` and `druglogics-synergy` modules
- Enabling *parallel simulations* in Gitsbe
- Added support for many features (ongoing work - see [dev_plan_doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OUupR0b-28YB9pVAww77RMecnFN6A39MYjXMjljmvG4/edit?usp=sharing))
- [druglogics-roc-generator](https://github.com/bblodfon/druglogics-roc-generator):
R shiny app to assess the performance of the Drabme results in the form of a 
ROC curve
- Export support using [BioLQM](https://github.com/colomoto/bioLQM): the 
initial model + best generation models can now be exported through configuration 
options to **GINML, SBML-Qual and BoolNet** community formats

## VSM

**Building VSM-dictionaries** in order to 
connect/translate the data from various databases and ontology providers to 
proper VSM-terms. Most of this work is done in order to support Vasundra's 
[causalBuilder Tool](https://vtoure.github.io/causalBuilder/) which is the 
first application of VSM after SciCura v1.

The vsm-dictionaries (code +documentation) can be found on the [VSM Github page](https://github.com/vsmjs). They translate to VSM-terms data from BioPortal, UniProt, Ensembl, EnsemblGenomes, RNACentral and ComplexPortal. We have also released the respective 
packages on [npmjs](https://www.npmjs.com/). See for example the [npm package for
BioPortal](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vsm-dictionary-bioportal).

## PSICQUIC

My work at the EBI with IntAct and Noemi Del Toro to extend the PSICQUIC web service to support the
miTab 2.8 data format/standard. See the [psicquic doc](http://psicquic.github.io/MITAB28Format.html) and the casualTab paper [@Perfetto2019].

I also worked with Noemi on the update of the [JAMI](https://github.com/MICommunity/psi-jami) 
library to also support miTab 2.8 - this is the culmination of results from the 
[BioHackathon 2018, in Paris](https://2018.biohackathon-europe.org/) and the 
[Marseille GREEKC hackathon event](https://github.com/GREEKC/hackathon-marseille/tree/master/project_descriptions/causal_psicquic).
