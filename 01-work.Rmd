# PhD work {#work}

This is a summary of all the work that I have done in my PhD until now. 
(mainly it's about software implementations related to the core technologies 
within the group). **To include in the thesis text**.

Note though that not all of these will be part of the main thesis (maybe include the 
rest in a section like 'Funny PhD side-quests').

## Druglogics Pipeline {#dlpipe}

- Lots of refactoring to increase the readability, maintainability and 
extendability of the source code (complete restructure of classes, addition of
others). 
This has **RRI extensions**, because cleaning and re-structuring software code has a social aspect to it in the sense that other people can now contribute more easily, extend the code, use it (user perspective can bring changes and further improvements to software pipeline even though they may be used for research purposes) - how can you expect users to actually use a piece of code when it's not substantially documented and it's internal logics made obscure because nobody gave attention to detail and structure? How can anybody care for a (software and any) product that you have not cared enough so as to present it in an way that is acceptable, managable and proper?
- Bug fixing
- Enable maven packaging for easier source compilation, testing, 
installation, management and executing of the code
- Added tests to modules `gitsbe` and `drabme` using JUnit5, mockito and assertJ libraries
- Source code documentation + proper README files on `gitsbe`, `drabme` and `druglogics-synergy` modules
- Enabling *parallel simulations* in Gitsbe (performance optimization)
- Added support for many features (ongoing work - see [dev_plan_doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OUupR0b-28YB9pVAww77RMecnFN6A39MYjXMjljmvG4/edit?usp=sharing))
- [druglogics-roc-generator](https://github.com/bblodfon/druglogics-roc-generator):
R shiny app to assess the performance of the Drabme results in the form of a 
ROC curve
- Export support using [BioLQM](https://github.com/colomoto/bioLQM): the 
initial model + best generation models can now be exported through configuration 
options to **GINML, SBML-Qual and BoolNet** community formats

## VSM {#vsm-dict}

**Building VSM-dictionaries** in order to connect/translate the data from various databases and ontology providers to proper VSM-terms. 
Most of this work is done in order to support Vasundra's [causalBuilder Tool](https://vtoure.github.io/causalBuilder/) which is the first application of VSM after SciCura v1.

The vsm-dictionaries (code + documentation) can be found on the [VSM Github page](https://github.com/vsmjs). 
They translate to VSM-terms data from BioPortal, UniProt, Ensembl, EnsemblGenomes, RNACentral, ComplexPortal and Noctua Entity Ontology. 
We have also released the respective packages on [npmjs](https://www.npmjs.com/). 
See for example the [npm package for BioPortal](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vsm-dictionary-bioportal).

## PSICQUIC

My work at the EBI with IntAct and Noemi Del Toro to extend the PSICQUIC web service to support the
miTab 2.8 data format/standard. See the [psicquic doc](http://psicquic.github.io/MITAB28Format.html) and the casualTab paper [@Perfetto2019].

I also worked with Noemi on the update of the [JAMI](https://github.com/MICommunity/psi-jami) 
library to also support miTab 2.8 - this is the culmination of results from the 
[BioHackathon 2018, in Paris](https://2018.biohackathon-europe.org/) and the 
[Marseille GREEKC hackathon event](https://github.com/GREEKC/hackathon-marseille/tree/master/project_descriptions/causal_psicquic).
