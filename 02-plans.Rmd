# PhD Tasks and Plans {#plans}

## Programming Tasks TODO

- Make the `vsm-pub-dictionaries` module (maybe, if I have time)

## Papers

Note that the titles and the details for each paper are liable to change though the core ideas behind should not. 

The papers dictate my future work for this PhD (and in that order!).

### Paper I: `emba` - an R package for ensemble boolean model biomarker analysis {-}

#### Authors {-}

John, Asmund

#### Idea {-}

This whole thing started when we questioned the predictive performance of the models generated by `Gitsbe`. 
What kind of insights can we get from such a dataset by looking at each individual model's boolean equations, stable states and predictive performance? 
How can we take back such knowledge and use it in order to understand more about how to generate better models in our pipeline?
How can we analyse each model's data to find nodes whose activity state or boolean model parameterization affects the manifestation of specific observed synergies? 
These questions and more of the same kind lead to a large data exploration and analyses, me writing a lot of `R` code, which I ended up splitting to two packages: [@R-usefun] and [@R-emba].

The idea behind the `emba` R package is to have simple functions that will help us analyse the models produced by `Gitsbe` in order to find important nodes (biomarkers) responsible for either better performance (based on a metric score like MCC) or for specific synergy(ies) prediction. 

#### What might come of this? {-}

- The R package emba [@R-emba] is publishable by itself as an **application note paper**, but we decided with Asmund that is best to present it with an analysis on some dataset to show its use. 
For example, the package is used for analyses that will be included in Asmund's paper(s), e.g. *AGS Story: Part I* among others.

- Another idea is to compare Machine Learning results with my method (on cascade/atopo results of the pipeline paper or other). 
Paper could be titled something along the lines of **"Ensemble model analysis vs Machine Learning for unraveling drug synergy mechanisms"**.

- Another idea here is the results of the project **Optimize the predictive performance of the Druglogics pipeline**. 
One of the research questions here is about the **identification of optimal training data size and included nodes which are essential for good performance** (with Eirini, I am leading it).

### Paper II: *VSM-dictionaries*: common access to biological dictionaries {-}

#### Authors {-}

John, Steven, Vasundra, Martin

#### Idea/Implementation {-}

A short **application note** paper for my work on [VSM-dictionaries](#vsm-dict).

## Synergy Paper Ideas

### Synergy Paper I {-}

#### Title {-}

Extending `SynergyFinder` for the use of multiple reference models for the assement of synergy in screening datasets.
A computational/mathematical paper.

#### Idea {-}

The core idea here is to extend an existing R package [@Ianevski2017] for calculating synergy reference models in order to include Wim's generalized Bliss method and the mean synergy score by Simone Laderer [@Lederer2018]!
Then I will test all the null reference models (Loewe, Bliss, ZIP + others) on dose-response matrix datasets (could be from Ladere's paper, from Asmund's paper, the SINTEF dataset) and see which is best at finding the synergies in each dataset.

Also, I should investigate if my own idea for a mathematical formulation of the volume-based synergy score as general method for describing 3-wise or more combinations as synergistic, could be part of this implementation.

### Synergy Paper II {-}

#### Title {-}

On eye-balling synergy mechanisms: What is a ~~mountain~~ synergy?

#### Idea {-}

I had the idea of writing a small paper that describes the *eye-balling* or *visual inspection* technique that is used so much in computational Biology and Medicine. 
It is used pretty much in any paper I have seen but nobody has actually defined or named it.

- A characteristic example is *eye-balling* synergies from dose-response curves, like we did in our group for the SINTEF screen data [@Flobak2019].
- Another example is the thresholds that data analysts put when defining output to classifiers or the parameterization that is used and the general human intuition/engineering that is shared in all these.

As Asmund once said:

> What is a mountain? What is a synergy?

- Asmund proposed that we should contact many people to curate large drug combination screens (various datasets) and combine this with Martin's idea of **creating curation guidelines for drug combination screening**.
