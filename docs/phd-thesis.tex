This is a summary of all the work that I have done in my PhD until now.
(mainly it's about software implementations related to the core technologies
within the group). \textbf{To include in the thesis text}.

Note though that not all of these will be part of the main thesis (maybe include the
rest in a section like `Funny PhD side-quests').

\hypertarget{pipeline}{%

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Lots of refactoring to increase the readability, maintainability and
  extendability of the source code (complete restructure of classes, addition of
  others).
  This has \textbf{RRI extensions}, because cleaning and re-structuring software code has a social aspect to it in the sense that other people can now contribute more easily, extend the code, use it (user perspective can bring changes and further improvements to software pipeline even though they may be used for research purposes) - how can you expect users to actually use a piece of code when it's not substantially documented and it's internal logics made obscure because nobody gave attention to detail and structure? How can anybody care for a (software and any) product that you have not cared enough so as to present it in an way that is acceptable, managable and proper?
\item
  Bug fixing
\item
  Enable maven packaging for easier source compilation, testing,
  installation, management and executing of the code
\item
  Added tests to modules \texttt{gitsbe} and \texttt{drabme} using JUnit5, mockito and assertJ libraries
\item
  Source code documentation + proper README files on \texttt{gitsbe}, \texttt{drabme} and \texttt{druglogics-synergy} modules
\item
  Enabling \emph{parallel simulations} in Gitsbe
\item
  Added support for many features (ongoing work - see \href{https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OUupR0b-28YB9pVAww77RMecnFN6A39MYjXMjljmvG4/edit?usp=sharing}{dev\_plan\_doc})

\hypertarget{vsm-dict}{%

\textbf{Building VSM-dictionaries} in order to

\href{https://vtoure.github.io/causalBuilder/}{causalBuilder Tool} which is the
first application of VSM after SciCura v1.

The vsm-dictionaries (code +documentation) can be found on the \href{https://github.com/vsmjs}{VSM Github page}. They translate to VSM-terms data from BioPortal, UniProt, Ensembl, EnsemblGenomes, RNACentral and ComplexPortal. We have also released the respective

  \tightlist
  \item
    Full BioLQM support: stable state calculation and trap spaces
  \item
    Do comparison between Aurelien's BioLQM stable state algorithm and

\hypertarget{idea}{%

\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Idea}

The idea here is to analyse the models produced by \texttt{Gitsbe} in order to find important nodes (biomarkers) responsible for either better performance (based on a metric score like TP or MCC) or for specific synergy(ies) prediction.

The R package emba (Zobolas \protect\hyperlink{ref-R-emba}{2019}) is publishable by itself as an \textbf{application note paper},
but we decided with Asmund that is best to present with an analysis on some dataset
to show it's use. The package is also used for analyses that will be included in
Asmund's automated pipeline paper (on the cascade topology mostly).

An idea is to compare ML results with my method (on cascade/atopo results of the pipeline
paper or other). Paper could be titled something along the lines of
\textbf{``Ensemble model analysis vs Machine Learning for unraveling drug synergy mechanisms''}.
(which depends only on me). Could also be that I combine Vasundra's and
Barbara's computational work on the biomarker analysis with mine and the ML
methods (so more generic even) to create a nice combo paper about \textbf{``Unraveling drug mechanisms on CRC
cell lines using various computational methods''}.

A research question here (with similar kind of work) is about the
\textbf{identification of optimal training data size}, in the sense that we can use
various methods to derive a node (biomarker) set for the training data (with Eirini).

\subsubsection*{Idea}\label{idea-1}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Idea}

This paper will be the main \textbf{research paper of my PhD}.
This idea is like a continuation of the \texttt{causalBuilder} tool by Vasundra coupled with the
need to have a more proper representation of complexes (and families) in our
logical models (better models, better predictions). Asmund had \emph{manually} changed some logical equations in his paper
(Flobak et al. \protect\hyperlink{ref-Flobak2015}{2015}), in order to make the model more compliant with biology knowledge
and literature findings. One of them was about the beta-catenin complex and its
constituents (connected with \emph{AND's} instead of \emph{OR's}) and the rest were about changing the link operators of the logical
equations (from \emph{AND NOT} to \emph{OR NOT}). The latter is something that is enabled
through the mutations introduced by the genetic algorithm of \texttt{Gitsbe}. The former
depends on the dataset and the representation of complexes.\footnote{There is actually a mutation that can change this but not in the way that we want - i.e.~all components of a complex
  should be connected with an \emph{AND}}

Only Signor has some complexes + interaction data but they are seperate files, making it thus difficult (and non-elegant computationally-wise) to integrate such knowledge/data to boolean models. Also Vasundra's experience with Reactome data in miTab2.8 showed us the difficulty to match binary interactions to a data model flexible enough to represent complexes and their internal components. Causal-JSON and the recursive schema that we thought allows the curator to put both the complex ID and it's constituents in the same data structure. And what's best than using a proper tool to annotate such causal statements like VSM!

\hypertarget{proposed-workflow}{%
\subsubsection*{Proposed Workflow}\label{proposed-workflow}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Proposed Workflow}

So, the general semi-automated web-application (web only if VSM comes into play) pipeline for this paper that I am thinking will be as follows:\footnote{My goal here is to combine as much as possible different things within our group,
  so each point or package should be small, their combination effect large}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Get interaction + complexes/families data (Signor most probably or a form of Cascade + complexes???). Note that for the reason I explained above miTab 2.8 is out of the question, so the Signor
  data I am refering to is the .tsv files they offer (interaction data, complexes, families). And
  most probably I am referring to a \textbf{pathway interaction dataset} not the whole Signor data. For example, the \href{https://signor.uniroma2.it/pathway_browser.php?organism=human\&pathway_list=SIGNOR-WNT\&level=1}{Wnt Signaling pathway}.
\item
  Build a small module that translates the (Signor) data to Causal-JSON.
\item
  Optionally\footnote{might actually take a lot more effort than what I am planning that's why it's optional}
  there can be support for (re-)curation of the data with VSM template(s) for proper annotation of complexes (the templates will be automatically pre-filled to match Signor's data model). Note that this implies causal-JSON =\textgreater{} VSM-box JSON format, which is the reverse
  of what causalBuilder will do. It will be nice if such interface supports addition
  of one more template of the same thing to curate one new sentence and add it to the data.
  The thing is that I want to include VSM into this, but I don't yet know how to really support
  its place in this pipeline since the curation is already done from Signor. It can be
  part of a showcase though: an example causal statement from the pathway with a complex
  and how it could be cureated with VSM.
\item
  \textbf{Main:} Build a package that translates the causal-JSON data to a logical model with
  some filtering and parameterization included (e.g.~filter based on cell line (so \emph{cell-line} specific topologies), conditions on the biological state: `by phoshorylation', exp. evidence, assertion/confidence score, species, compartment).
  So, \textbf{causal-JSON to .bnet files (logical equations)}, while substituting nicely\footnote{huge
    discussion here, but I already know what to do pretty much} the complexes and families.
\item
  Showcase some small application of this logical model end-product:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    use for example the \href{https://github.com/colomoto/colomoto-docker}{colomoto notebook}, do some small trapspace analysis and show that some results from literature or from previous logical or other models can now be reproduced with a better biological representation in the model itself
  \item
    make many logical models of the pathways in Signor with simple attractor analysis and put them into the GinSim model repository for reference for the logical community.
  \item
    extend \texttt{atopo} module to use the main (3) package and use it for finding drug combinations (comparing attractors or prediction results of automated topology building without complexes vs automated topology built from causal-JSON with complexes and families in each case).
    The main thing here would be of course better prediction performance results based on a better logical model representation.
    I could tweak \texttt{atopo} to choose actually not all of Signor's data but specific pathways to include in the analysis and this will help I believe to build smaller topologies for specific drug combinations that we want to test.
  \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

Extending \texttt{SynergyFinder} for the use of multiple reference models for the assement of synergy in screening datasets

\hypertarget{idea-2}{%
\subsubsection*{Idea}\label{idea-2}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Idea}

The core idea here is to extend an existing R package for calculating synergy
reference models in order to include Wim's generalized Bliss method and the mean synergy score by Simone Laderer! Then I will test all the null reference models (Loewe, Bliss, ZIP, +2 new, others?) on dose-response matrix datasets (could be from Ladere's paper, from Asmund's paper, our own - Barbara's/Evelina's dataset, etc.) and see which is best at finding the synergies in each dataset.

R package to use:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  SynergyFinder from Finland group \href{https://github.com/google/synergyfinderengineered/}{code here}
\item
  Also I have to check this software: \href{https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5732778/}{R package COMBIA} as well as others at the time I will be tackling this
\end{itemize}

Also, I should investigate if my own idea for a mathematical
formulation of the volume-based synergy score as general method for describing 3-wise
or more combinations as synergistic, could be part of this implementation (or could be another paper by itself).

On eye-balling synergy mechanisms: What is a \sout{mountain} synergy?

\hypertarget{idea-3}{%
\subsubsection*{Idea}\label{idea-3}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Idea}

I had the idea of writing a small paper (send to Science Signaling) that describes the \emph{eye-ball} or
\emph{visual inspection} technique that is used so much in computational Biology and
Medicine. It is used pretty much in any paper I have seen but nobody has actually
defined or named it.

A characteristic example is the \emph{call for synergy} when you see some
experimental data in dose-response curves (show mostly when you see figures). Another is the threshold that data analysts put when defining output to classifiers or the parameterization that is used and the general human intuition/engineering that is shared in all these.

As Asmund once said:

\begin{quote}
What is a mountain? What is a synergy?
\end{quote}

So, I just want to discuss this in a small paper cause it seems to be a
thing that everybody is aware of in their everyday job, but everyone keeps out
when talking about results, etc and I haven't found a paper that discusses this
one way or another!
A very RRI-related paper\ldots{}

\chapter{PhD ideas}\label{ideas}}

Several ideas that I may do or not in my PhD but I still keep here for my future
investigations!

\hypertarget{quantum}{%
\section{Quantum logic formalism}\label{quantum}}

My favourite! Investigate if instead of a logical modeling formalism, the idea
of (quantum) logical gates can be used to represent and analyse protein interaction
networks.
The \textbf{core idea} makes sense: you don't know the state of a protein, but when
you measure it, only then you really know what it is.

May also be worth to look at a \href{https://doi.org/10.1007/11885191_18}{game-theoritic approach}
to find attractors and such.

\hypertarget{comp}{%
\section{Compare fixpoint tools}\label{comp}}

Idea: Compare different tools that calculate fixpoints for logical modeling.
Faster wins of course :)

Models used for testing could be of different types:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  self-contained
\item
  varying the number of input nodes (1-n)
\item
  small to large number of nodes
\item
  small to large number of edges
\item
  scale-free (boolnet generated) vs random (varying K connectivity)
\item
  play with form of the boolean equations
\item
  others ???
\end{itemize}

Workflow for this includes:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  support BNReduction data format by \href{https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2105-15-221}{Veliz-Cuba}
  in BioLQM
\item
  add support for calculating the fixpoints using the Colomoto docker (python
  interface) + BNReduction
\item
  then comparison between \textbf{BioLQM, Pint, MABOSS and BNReduction} could be done then
  in a Jupiter colomoto-enabled notebook!
\end{itemize}

Further extension/comparisons could be:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  (Akutsu, Hayashida, and Tamura \protect\hyperlink{ref-Akutsu2009}{2009}) - Integer programming method
\item
  (Dubrova and Teslenko \protect\hyperlink{ref-Dubrova2009}{2009}) - SAT-based
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{reasoning-with-vsm}{%
\section{Reasoning with VSM}\label{reasoning-with-vsm}}

The idea here is to use VSM to annotate sentences about some knowledge area,
store this information in a format like RDF or something else (graph database?)
and then ask questions that will enable you to learn stuff that you didn't know
before.

One goal would be to show the superiority of \emph{connection-based reasoning}
(humans and what VSM encapsulates) vs \emph{logic reasoning} (OWL).

Another thing I thought was to just translate the VSM-data to PROLOG
and then ask questions using that logical language framework. It is a way to show
that you \emph{learned} something using the VSM-supported curation but I don't know
where to go from there\ldots{} this whole knowledge semantics and reasoning stuff
seem to be a PhD on its own :) There are a lot of things that should
be investigated for this idea to materialize properly (lots of reading).

An idea by Steven:

Mapping / inferring different forms of representing interactions (molecular
and/vs.~causal) using a VSM sentence presentation as a graph diagram. A first
step to reasoning would be to make some rules like, if you have VSM-sentences
A and B, then you can infer C from that.

\textbf{My idea} is more like this:\\
Predict drug-response curves from drug combination datasets (GDSC, CCLE),
using logical modeling for singaling network analysis or translation from
logical to ODE modeling. Also try to predict drug combinations datasets
(dose-response matrices?). Pretty much what is done in this paper (Fröhlich et al. \protect\hyperlink{ref-Frohlich2018}{2018})
with help from (Wittmann et al. \protect\hyperlink{ref-Wittmann2009}{2009}) for converting boolean models to continuous.

Nice idea because it's related to music!
Investigate if \href{https://doi.org/10.1016/j.proeng.2016.07.510}{this algorithm}
could be used for optimizing the boolean equations for \texttt{gitsbe} - thus opening the
stage for \texttt{JazzLogics}.

\hypertarget{train-models-to-cell-specific-proliferation}{%
\subsection{Train models to cell-specific proliferation}\label{train-models-to-cell-specific-proliferation}}

Concept is that training models to proliferate provides a wider variance of models than the
cell-specific trained ones in \texttt{gitsbe}: main directive is \textbf{proliferation},
not just fitting to a steady state pattern. So a hybrid training approach should
be way more advantageous.

\hypertarget{a-bottom-up-model-building-for-drug-prediction}{%
\subsection{A bottom-up model building for drug prediction}\label{a-bottom-up-model-building-for-drug-prediction}}

Start with a model and some observed synergies. Build/train/produce models that
predict the first observed synergy (using Harmony Search?), from them the next
one, etc. You end up with many models that can predict all the observed
synergies or you try to find out why that cannot happen for example (e.g.~
contrasting synergies?). Do the latest models' stable states or attractors
correspond to activity of proteins from literature?

\hypertarget{simulate-cancer-resistance}{%
\subsection{Simulate cancer resistance}\label{simulate-cancer-resistance}}

For example, you have some models that predict some (observed) synergies or you
just find some synergistic drug comibnations for these models or per model.
Then, you modify these models in order to be resistant to these drugs, simulating
thus the cancer rewiring process! Then, you apply (n+1) drug combinations to
win over the resistance (and you do this procedure at more levels to suggest
3-way, 4-way drug combos and why there might be cancer models that can `win'
over these models and continue the proliferation). You end up with super cancer
resistant models and methods to achieve them or reasons why this cannot happen
at all.
