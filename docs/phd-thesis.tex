I first acknowledge funding from the \textbf{ERACoSysMed project COLOSYS}. Now to people, the most important part: \textbf{I would like to thank everyone} that interacted with me during the years I conducted my PhD research (2017-2021), even for a tiny bit. A person is only a small node in a complex network of interactions, which only when considered together, make up the person. In other words, you are not just you! So, you were \textbf{all important} for me (and for others I am sure)! Importance though is measured in varying degrees. Therefore now, I will proceed to give some personal credits (the part that most of you came here to read :)

A big \textbf{THANK YOU} to my supervisor, Prof.~Martin Kuiper. He gave me the opportunity to come to Norway, which opened a world of possibilities. The dream supervisor everyone should have and a caring human being above all. A true gentleman and an unsurpassed cook as well!

To Dr.~Åsmund Flobak for excellent co-supervision, the nice scientific discussions we had and for introducing me into \texttt{R}, which largely influenced the way I do science. Spending time with his lively family was always a nice change of pace. That day we were all together at Amsterdam's zoo and I saw my first penguins, will remain unforgettable!

To Dr.~Steven Vercruysse for our scientific discussions and for teaching me and ins and outs of web software development. I will never forget the ELIXIR Biohackathon 2020, great laughs and great work, all in one. And of course, I will never forget the ``tour'' . Thanks Steven!

To Prof.~Astrid Laegreid, for suggesting to me to participate in the Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI) course, which inspired me to think more broadly about my research and the world we live in, and of course meet several wonderful people! That's also how I became acquainted with Digital Life Norway (DLN). Liv Eggset Falkenberg did an excellent job at coordinating the DLN Research School and she was co-organizer of the Walkshop in Jotunheimen (September 2019), which was a truly wonderful experience. With DLN, I had the benefit of participating in various conferences across Norway and the opportunity to do an industry internship in Sweden during the cold winter of 2021, so thanks DLN and Liv!

To Noemi Del Toro Ayllon, for introducing me to the professional world of software development and project management with Java. Visiting the IntAct team at EBI during the summer of 2018 was a memorable experience and when she came to Trondheim later in 2019, we had such a great time, so thank you Noe!

To Henning Hermjacob, for not just being the scientific host for my visits to EBI in England, but also for hosting me in his lovely Airbnb house each time! Spending a few months in Cambridge during my PhD was a truly marvelous experience, so thanks Henning!

To Professors Denis Thieffry, Pedro T. Monteiro and Jin-Dong Kim for the nice discussions we had, resulting in excellent collaborations.

And of course, \textbf{to my colleagues from the DrugLogics group}, for the good times we spent inside and outside of work! I am especially grateful to Barbara Niederdorfer and Evelina Folkesson for our music sessions. Eirini Tsirvouli has been a very positive, dynamic presence. Rafel Riudavets Puig has been a really close friend - I hope that in the future we get to continue our random walks that somehow always end up in McDonalds! Marcio Luis Acencio has been a good friend as well, with a wonderful family that gained two new members I got to meet before he left our group! Vasundra Touré has been a wonderful colleague, a true source of light for the time we spend at our office in Gloshaugen (and it was really dark in general). Wine, cheese, standards and good memories! Also, favorite cafe buddies with Anamika Chatterjee - we certainly made Espresso House richer (though I later switched to Dromedar, say sorry)!

Last but not least, a big \textbf{THANKS} to the beautiful city of Trondheim! I've had some really inspirational walks in these historic roads. And to its nice coffee shops I've been working throughout my PhD! Diverse working environment is extremely important and as it was perfectly stated:

\indent

Cancer is one the most prevalent human diseases.
The scientific community has devoted considerable efforts to understand the mechanisms behind this disease and search for treatments that promise a better quality of life for patients.
To accomplish this goal, Biology and Medicine have joined forces with Computer Sciences, using the power of Computational modeling, Mathematics, Machine Learning and Statistics.
This interdisciplinary effort to address the cancer problem, constitutes the basis upon which this thesis was formed.
We present several contributions to this effort, consisting of software, data analyses and mathematical investigations, which have enabled the more efficient curation of biological knowledge, the use of computer models to prioritize drug treatments for cancer and the derivation of molecular mechanistic insights from the simulation results.

In order to build a computational model of a biological system such as a cancer cell, we first need a way to describe the structure of such a system.
A common network-based approach provides an elegant representation of such a structure, where molecular entities such as proteins and genes are connected to each other via causal interactions, which in turn determine cellular behavior and the functional properties of the cell as an integrated system of individual components.
These interactions form the Prior Knowledge Network (PKN), which serves as the basic building block for most computational biological models. Nonetheless, several challenges exist, even at this early stage of the modeling process.

The first problem is that biological information by its very nature is largely complex, and therefore its formalization to a structured, computable form for use in modeling applications, demands extra attention.
The translation of scientific knowledge from publications into such a computable form is achieved with the use of specialized software tools and is the main responsibility of biocurators.
In order to help biocurators be more efficient in their annotation tasks, we proposed the Visual Syntax Method (VSM) as an alternative approach for general-purpose knowledge formalization.
In particular, we implemented a user interface component (VSM-box) that enables curators to annotate any type of information, no matter its complexity, and translate it into an intuitive, flexible sentence-like format.
This software was used to build a prototype curation interface (CausalBuilder) for the annotation of molecular causal interactions, which constitute the cornerstone of a model's PKN.

\newpage

The second problem concerns the availability and ease of access of causal molecular interaction data for modeling or other scientific endeavors.
A standard format for the representation of such signaling information was developed (CausalTAB), and we supported the export of the causality statements from CausalBuilder's interface to this format.
But there exist several other molecular interaction databases that could update their data to fit the new CausalTAB standard.
PSICQUIC is a web-service platform that was initially built so that users can conveniently fetch in a standard way molecular interaction data from different sources.
We extended PSICQUIC to incorporate the new CausalTAB format, so that causality-enriched information generated by our curation prototype tool or from other data providers could be shared through a common channel.

A third major problem arose during the design process of the VSM-box and it's application, CausalBuilder.
Behind the scenes, the curator interface has to communicate with a large number of diverse biological data resources, each with its own online API service that provides access to the respective data.
In order to present to the user the available terms that pertain to a specific annotation of interest, a uniform way to query all these resources was needed.
This prompted us to build the Unified Biological Dictionaries (UBDs), a software suite that provides a unified gateway for life science data, helping users retrieve the right query terms.
In addition, curators sometimes come across new knowledge that is not yet available through the standard authoritative resources.
To address this related problem, we connected UBDs with PubDictionaries, an online resource of simple dictionaries, allowing curators to publicly create and share ad-hoc terms, and further use them as annotations in VSM-based applications.

After the signaling information has been curated and the causal interactions assembled to form the PKN, we then need to specify the mathematical equations of the cancer cell model.
This allows us to describe and analyze its dynamical behavior subject to external stimuli, such as drug perturbations.
The modeling approaches can in general range from qualitative to quantitative and in this work we focused on Boolean modeling, where signaling components are assigned either an active or inactive state.
An automated computational pipeline was developed to produce an ensemble of Boolean models from a PKN, calibrated to a specific cancer cell signaling phenotype.
These models are then analyzed to suggest possible synergistic drug combinations and the results are compared with experimental findings, where all possible combinations are tested in a high-throughput screen setup.
We demonstrated that our pipeline could prioritize specific drug combinations, reducing the number of drugs that need to be tested in experiments, before a viable treatment is found for a patient.
Moreover, several analyses indicated that our models can be used to derive mechanistic insights about the diseased model and generate novel biological hypotheses.
Lastly, we showed the significance of the PKN quality, where even small modifications to the cancer signaling network could severely affect our pipeline's drug prediction performance.

\newpage

To exploit the range of parameterizations present in the Boolean models produced by our pipeline, we devised several strategies to split and compare the different models in a dedicated R package (emba).
This supplementary effort allowed us to find potential biomarkers, which are nodes whose state is decisive for the global behavior of the models and can indicate parts of the PKN that are responsible for a drug combination to be synergistic.
Additionally, we noticed particular patterns in the way specific equations always correspond to specific signaling states in our models, so we more deeply investigated the influence of the choice of parameterization on the output behavior of these nodes.
This led us to propose a list of Boolean function metrics that can assist modelers in choosing more appropriate equations, meaning those that are consistent with the regulatory information present in the PKN and whose expected output better matches experimental observations.
Finally, results from a study of diverse Boolean functions indicated that these also exhibit diverse output behaviors, with some being highly biased towards specific Boolean outcomes while others depending more on the ratio between positive and negative regulators, as these are derived from the two distinct types of causal interactions present in the model's PKN.

Scientific and technological progress has been the foundation for some of the most astounding achievements of humankind.
In the last century in particular, discoveries were made that contributed to the sustainable development of the economy and society, affecting our lives in an unprecedented manner and making possible what was considered impossible.
The invention of the digital computer and the Internet for example, revolutionized the access, dissemination and analysis of information {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-Abbate2000}{8},\protect\hyperlink{ref-Naughton2016}{9}{]}.
We have been to the Moon, a breakthrough that has opened up the possibilities of space exploration and interstellar travel.
The industrial revolution of the latest century has enabled us to design machines for every conceivable need.
Human well-being has become significantly better: compare a middle class household and the appliances within, with one from 60 years ago.
With a higher standard of living and the ongoing efforts to alleviate hunger, poverty and inequality on a global scale, people have started caring more about the planet, paving the way for sustainable economic and environmental growth {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-Polasky2019}{10}{]}.
Due to advancements in Biology and Medicine, the application of public health interventions such as vaccinations and hygiene measures has become common practice, causing a rapid increase in the global life expectancy during the last century {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-Roser2013}{11}{]}.
The genome-editing technology CRISPR {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-Jinek2012}{12}{]} has enabled the discovery of new therapeutic solutions for a variety of genetic diseases and has been beneficially used in several agriculture and plant biotechnology applications {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-Zhu2020}{13}{]}.
The list of achievements is truly endless and all the data points to the fact that the world is getting better {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-Bailey2020}{14}{]}.

There are three factors that have made technological progress possible.
Firstly, every human innovation is based on basic scientific research, without which the development of new technologies would have been impossible.
Secondly, society is developing new contracts with science {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-Gibbons1999}{15}{]}, where researchers can only be trusted to continue their work (and get funding for it), if they tackle real-world problems and produce knowledge characterized by a fully transparent and participative spirit.
Practically, this means that better communication skills are a necessity for today's scientists and that their research should have translational potential to deliver on society's expectations.
But solving these real-world problems is incredibly hard, and so, they cannot be addressed by applying knowledge from specific fields only, e.g.~either from the Computer or the Biological Sciences alone.
This brings us to the third factor: in order for science to deliver on its promises to society, collaboration across fields of science is the only way forward.

Medicine, from research to develop new therapies up to delivering the actual product or services to the patients, constitutes the perfect example that encompasses all three reasons that have enabled progress to transpire in its domain.
It first starts with a real-life problem: people get sick.
The existence of diseases is a societal problem and a hard one at that, since people usually lack the necessary knowledge or the means to deal with it on their own.
They have in fact exchanged some of their freedom to have a place in society, and ensure that they receive proper treatment when needed (along with other forms of security, access to free education, etc.).
To manage such a complex problem, society provides healthcare services, which have significantly increased across the world in recent years {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-HAQ2015}{16}{]}.
For most people, the single most applied healthcare interaction is the use of drugs, prescribed by medical doctors.
Drugs are the translational product of the pharmaceutical industry, which is the result of basic interdisciplinary research.
Medical doctors alone wouldn't be able to find the cause and understand the mechanisms behind many of the diseases that exist today.
This knowledge has been the culmination of years of scientific knowledge, built atop collaboration across fields, from Medicine and Biology to Computer Science and Engineering.

So, only by using every possible method and knowledge at our disposal and by working together, we can achieve the solution to complex problems such as human diseases.
When these conditions are met, societal challenges can be addressed and science stands as one unified body for the good and progress of all mankind.
The field of Systems Medicine has been the direct embodiment of this notion, promising improved prevention, prognosis, diagnosis and treatment of patients via an integrative, interdisciplinary approach {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-Apweiler2018}{17}{]}.

One of the simplest ways to conceptualize complex systems, either man-made or existing freely in nature, is using the notion of a \emph{network} or \emph{graph}.
The idea is that any system is composed of individual entities or components of interest (nodes) and these components interact with each other in various, usually non-obvious ways (links).
These two properties, namely having some objects to study, and relationships between these objects, form the basis for the conceptualization of a network (Figure \ref{fig:fig1}).
From a cognitive point of view, the conceptualization of a network manifests as a visual representation in our brain, consisting of a bunch of dots (nodes) connected with numerous lines (links) {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-Trudeau1976}{18}{]}.
Such a projection is usually close to what people instinctively draw on paper when they attempt to describe their knowledge about a system and its inner workings (thereby ``connecting the dots'').
Simple schematics that are abstractly similar to dots and lines, along with further contextual information (e.g.~node labels, coloring, directed links, etc.), seem to be able to capture and render information derived from our thought processes, in a unique and comprehensible way.



\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{phd-thesis_files/figure-latex/fig1-1} \includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{phd-thesis_files/figure-latex/fig1-2} \caption{Two examples of networks, composed of dots and lines. The left network is a random graph based on the Erdős--Rényi model {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-Erdos1960}{19}{]} and the one on the right is created using the preferential attachment principle that characterizes scale-free networks with hub nodes, such as the World Wide Web {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-Barabasi1999}{20}{]}.}\label{fig:fig1}
\end{figure}

Since studying complex systems falls intro the domain of science's responsibilities, and graphs seem to be an intuitive way of representing such systems, the emergence of a new field called network science was inevitable {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-Barabasi2013}{21}{]}.
Its purpose is to establish a unified set of tools and methods to study the properties of any type of network that emerges across disparate fields.
A variety of software tools for network visualization and analysis have been released throughout the years, ranging from generic-purpose {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-Csardi2006}{22}--\protect\hyperlink{ref-Shannon2003}{25}{]}, to tools more suitable for studying biological {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-Dahlquist2002}{26}--\protect\hyperlink{ref-Sidiropoulos2017}{29}{]} or social networks {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-Smith2009}{30},\protect\hyperlink{ref-Kalamaras2014}{31}{]}.
The use of such tools enables the discovery of fundamental laws that characterize the function of systems represented by networks.
In addition, it allows us to study in detail the networks' systemic structure and derive key principles that drive their evolution and emergent behavior.
Anthropological research for example uses network theory to study people and their relationships, and explain emergent complex phenomena such as human behavior.
Neuroscience uses network analysis methods to detect anomalies in diseased human brains {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-Chatterjee2021}{32}{]}.
The impact of online social networks is studied to understand and predict future personal and profit-oriented communication (online marketing) {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-Mislove2007}{33}{]}.
Epidemiologists use graph-based methods to model the spread of diseases like COVID-19, predict the future course of outbreaks and evaluate strategies to control epidemics {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-Maheshwari2020}{34}{]}.
Molecular biologists study intra- and intercellular signaling networks to understand the mechanisms behind biological processes and investigate the causes of network dysregulation, often leading to the emergence of particular disease phenotypes.
Such network-based approaches have significant clinical applications since they have the potential to assist in the discovery of new disease genes and modules, and the identification of drug targets and biomarkers for complex diseases {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-Barabasi2011}{35}{]}.

The work presented in this thesis is heavily based on this network medicine paradigm, with causal molecular interaction networks as the main object of study.
Our primary focus is on protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks, with proteins as nodes and their physical contacts and interactions as links, and gene regulatory networks, represented for example by directed regulatory relationships between transcription factors and genes (TF-TG networks).
These types of networks demonstrate a system of signal transduction pathways connected by crosstalk and embedded in feedback loops, forming what is known as the \emph{Prior Knowledge Network} (PKN).
The causality property of the PKN stems from the fact that the network links are directed (i.e.~protein X affects protein Y) and signed (Y is inhibited or activated as a result).
It's exactly this causality information that allows the investigation of behaviors from a systems perspective.
Such networks form the basis for the study and computational modeling of cancer, which is another subject of investigation in this thesis.
In the subsequent chapters, we will discuss how we addressed problems related to the formalization, access and public sharing of the knowledge encoded in the PKN.

Where does the information that is used to build knowledge networks originate from?
One of the most widely adopted ways to record and share knowledge, has been the publication of scientific findings in specialized journals.
This has resulted in a major challenge that researchers in the life sciences face, which is to stay updated with the huge amount of information that is published on a daily basis (Figure \ref{fig:fig2}).
It becomes impossible for the average scientist to find, read, extract and use that information in an efficient manner without the use of databases.
Even when using databases, one is often confronted with both chronically incomplete knowledge, and also a lack of sufficient contextual information to assess when exactly the knowledge is valid.



\begin{figure}

\caption{Human vs Life-Science Literature. How can humans stay up-to-date with increasing knowledge stored in PDF files? {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-Vercruysse2019a}{36}{]}}\label{fig:fig2}
\end{figure}

A severe problem lies already at the data entry stage.
Biocurators are people whose main task is to read the scientific literature and translate knowledge into a precise, computable form, ready to be inserted into databases {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-Howe2008}{37},\protect\hyperlink{ref-Ammari2018}{38}{]}.
The huge body of literature existing today is full of inconsistencies and inaccuracies, so expert interpretation and annotation are essential.
But current databases are limited in what they can contain, because there exists no easy way to properly transfer all kinds of complex knowledge or ideas into them, in the first place.
Moreover, the annotation tools that biocurators use are not intuitive nor flexible enough to be used by large crowds of people, to convert vast amounts of relevant knowledge from the scientific literature into the respective databases.
The insufficient funding to curate scientific results into databases, and the cost of creating a new knowledge base for every new project, are some extra confounding factors.
Because of this, researchers all over the world have to spend considerable time performing ad-hoc manual curation of publications that are relevant for their project, often with improvised approaches (Word, Excel).
At best they also spend time developing a specialized curation platform or computational methods to extract knowledge, which can only capture a fraction of the ``actual reported truth'' {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-Jenssen2001}{39}{]}.
Nonetheless, all these efforts form a significant part of the scientific enterprise, assisting in the creation of digital knowledge repositories, which are subsequently used to build PKNs for the computational modeling of biological processes.

\vspace{15pt}

A list of tools have been created to assist biocurators in their annotation tasks.
Notably, the IntAct editor is an open-source desktop application software that enables IntAct curators and members of the IMEx consortium to annotate molecular interactions {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-intact-editor}{40}{]}.
Because of the lack of installation instructions and documentation, coupled with a complex interface, specialized training from senior IntAct curators is required to learn how to use this software.
Nonetheless, it is one of the most used and effective tools for the job, since it has been around for a lot of years and during that time, there has always been a spirit of close collaboration between developers and curators to implement features, solve bugs and in general improve the annotation capabilities of the software.
Canto is another tool that was built to support community curation in the PomBase fission yeast database {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-Rutherford2014}{41}{]}.
It has now expanded its original purpose to support curation of other model organism databases and different molecular data types (e.g.~annotation of a larger set of GO terms).
Canto's respective website provides extensive documentation and step-by-step user guidance throughout the annotation procedure {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-canto-doc}{42}{]}.
A user management mechanism is incorporated in the software so as to allow proper monitoring of curation tasks and efficient communication between curators for work prioritization.
In addition, two relatively new tools have been developed for the curation and visualization of molecular interaction maps: NaviCell {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-Kuperstein2013}{43}{]} and MINERVA {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-Gawron2016}{44}{]}.
These tools facilitate knowledge exploration in addition to knowledge annotation, allowing for an interactive user experience (e.g.~feedback via comments), enabling content sharing, supporting well known data standards (e.g.~SBGN {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-Novere2009}{45}{]}) and thus allowing for data interoperability and re-use.
All the aforementioned annotation tools are limited by the fact that they aren't generic enough to curate any type of information, with most of them representing specialized solutions pertaining to specific annotation purposes.
Most tools require extra technical configurations and software to include additional levels of contextualized details required for current and future curation efforts.

\newpage

To obtain support from computational pipelines that will help us process the vast amounts of knowledge and advance our understanding of processes in nature, we must be able to efficiently annotate and store information that is highly detailed and contextualized.
Hereby, the knowledge's inherent complexity should be kept manageable and understandable by humans and machines alike.
In order to accommodate for a much more powerful, flexible, and reusable annotation process, an intuitive curation and knowledge formalization method was developed, called VSM (Visual Syntax Method) {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-vsm-paper}{46}{]}.
VSM enables scientists to capture any type of knowledge with any type of contextual information, in a way that is understandable by both humans and computers.

Part of the work in this thesis has been to assist in the implementation of a software module that implements VSM as a general-purpose, web-based user interface, named VSM-box {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-vsm-box}{5}{]}.
This software component was used to build CausalBuilder, a prototype curation interface for the annotation of causal molecular interactions {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-Toure2021}{6}{]}.
CausalBuilder uses VSM to generate concrete, customizable templates that represent causal statements.
It supports the export of the annotated statements in standard signaling formats, such as CausalTAB {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-Perfetto2019}{7}{]}, which can be stored in relevant databases or used to build computational models of biological processes.
To support the large variety of contextual information related to causal molecular interactions between biological entities, allowing for a finer disambiguation between seemingly similar or conflicting causality statements (e.g.~a transcription factor simultaneously up and down regulating a target gene in different cellular contexts), CausalBuilder was designed to comply with a list of guidelines (MI2CAST) that were developed exactly for this purpose {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-Toure2020}{47}{]}.
All in all, CausalBuilder provides biologists and curators with a simple user interface for the annotation of causal regulatory knowledge, translating highly contextual information about molecular interactions from scientific publications to a computable form.

\indent

During the design process of the VSM-box tool and its application, CausalBuilder, we came across a critical technical issue that needed to be addressed, and whose resolution had ramifications outside of the intended scope of our work.
Due to the high degree of complexity within the domain of biology, biocurators need to annotate diverse information, taken from a plethora of biological resources and vocabularies.
To enable a wider expressiveness in the annotation of causal statements, the recommended list of ontologies and vocabularies of the MI2CAST standard had to be rather extensive {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-mi2cast-doc}{48}{]}.
Since CausalBuilder conforms to the MI2CAST standard, a unified way to retrieve, format and display vocabulary terms from different databases was needed.
We illustrate this with an example: in Figure \ref{fig:fig3}, a simple VSM-template that a curator can use to annotate a causal statement with CausalBuilder is shown.
Following the MI2CAST guidelines, the source entity of the causal statement (first box in Figure \ref{fig:fig3}) must always be specified and a list of recommended resources where the annotation could potentially originate from is provided {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-mi2cast-doc}{48}{]}.
We limit the number of these resources to three in this example, making it so that the source biological entity can be annotated as a protein (from UniProt {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-TheUniProtConsortium2019}{49}{]}), a complex (from Complex Portal {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-Meldal2019}{50}{]}), or an RNA transcript (from RNAcentral {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-RNACentral2018}{51}{]}).
The intended use case is that the curator will type in a string (e.g.~``tp53'') and a list of terms and descriptive metadata from the three respective standard databases will be returned.
This information can be displayed by VSM-box in an autocomplete drop-down menu to ease the selection of the appropriate term by the curator.



\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{img/causalBuilder_screenshot} \caption{Querying multiple data resources using the VSM-box technology in CausalBuilder. The user enters a string of interest and selects a list of resource types (not shown here) for the source entity, following the MI2CAST curation guidelines. The UBDs stand as a hidden translator between the query launched from the curator interface and the respective database data, returning a list of uniformly-structured matches, shown as a drop-down list to the user. The matches consist of a curator-friendly main term (shown in blue) and metadata like identifier, name of species, textual description, resource name etc., that a user can use to disambiguate between the different concepts.}\label{fig:fig3}
\end{figure}

\newpage

We can now clearly state the heart of the problem: the resources that offer protein, RNA and multiprotein complex data, have different online APIs to serve their information, and it is usually structured in diverse formats.
Therefore, it was necessary to design a generic solution that would translate all the necessary information from the recommended resources of the MI2CAST standard into a unified representation schema.
Then, we could implement modules that ``talk'' to the databases and translate the provided information into this uniform data format.
As a result of having a standardized way to represent data from various disparate resources, VSM-box and other curation tools could easily process the returned data load and create drop-down menus to help users in their annotation tasks (as shown in Figure \ref{fig:fig3}).
The outcome of all this effort was the implementation of UBDs (Unified Biological Dictionaries, see \textbf{\protect\hyperlink{Paper1}{Paper 1}}).
The reason for the name \emph{dictionaries} originates from the abstract data type called \emph{associative array} (also known as \emph{map} or \emph{dictionary}), which is a collection of (\emph{key, value}) pairs, and is an integrated feature of many programming languages.
For our application, we reasoned that the minimum information that is needed for the unique identification of concepts for curation tasks is a computer-friendly ID and a human-friendly term, precisely matching the \emph{key} and \emph{value} of the associative array's data structure.

An unforeseen consequence of the UBDs implementation was that by covering most of the vocabularies and ontologies recommended by the MI2CAST standard, we ended up mapping into a unified format a large amount of diverse terminologies across life sciences.
This happened because our solution encapsulated and extended other similar efforts, such as the BioPortal {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-Whetzel2011}{52}{]} and EBI Search {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-Madeira2019}{53}{]} web services.
We therefore managed to bring even more biomedical ontologies and biological data resources under one umbrella, and subsequently increase the accessibility, interoperability and reusability of the provided data {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-Wilkinson2016}{54}{]}.
So, even though UBDs main user is the software engineer building curation tools (as we were at the beginning of this effort with CausalBuilder), several computational researchers can benefit from our implementation, if they need to query disparate biological resources for lightweight information (i.e.~terms, identifiers and some metadata) using a single programmatic interface.
In the end, the feedback we got from biocurators who tested the CausalBuilder tool was very encouraging, pointing out that we had proceeded in the right direction with our efforts to build UBDs, the hidden machinery enabling all the autocomplete ``magic'' to happen in VSM-box's user interface.

The implementation of UBDs put us in a position to confront problems that biocurators face during their annotation tasks, which haven't yet been properly addressed by any existing technology.
One of these challenges is that biocurators often need to annotate terms in a specific domain or novel field, for which there is still no authoritative database or ontology nor a community consensus about the respective terminology {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-Hartmann2019}{55}{]}.
A similar challenge manifests when new knowledge is discovered or similarly, further contextual information related to existing knowledge comes into light, as a result of scientists' constant drive for progress.
This eventually leads to the constant refactoring of ontologies and identifiers, subsequently making biocurators life even more difficult.
To respond to these challenges, biocurators create project-specific, \emph{ad-hoc} vocabularies that aren't openly accessible and usually become obsolete after some time passes.
We reasoned that with the UBDs infrastructure in place, we could do better.

In summary, the core of the problem is two-fold: first, biocurators need a simple way to annotate new information that does not yet exist in any resource and second, this information needs to be shared publicly for further review and management by expert communities.
To tackle this problem, we collaborated with experts from PubDictionaries, an online repository of publicly accessible and editable dictionaries {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-Kim2019}{56}{]}.
Using the online interface of PubDictionaries, curators can create simple dictionaries, consisting of terms and identifiers of their own choice, solving the second part of the problem.
Additionally, by updating the PubDictionaries API and connecting all existing and future public dictionaries with UBDs and their underlying unified format, we streamlined their use in annotation tools and solved the first part of the problem.
The technical work was carried out during an intense hacking week at the ELIXIR Biohackathon 2021 event and the implementation details are described in \textbf{\protect\hyperlink{Paper2}{Paper 2}} of this thesis.
As a final result, we showcased a demo in which curators could use their public, ad-hoc terminologies from PubDictionaries, to annotate a simple sentence using the VSM-box interface.

\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Sharing causal interactions with PSICQUIC}

\indent

Defining standards is a very important initiative across scientific disciplines, since it facilitates the accessibility and sharing of information amongst data users as well as the interoperability of software tools that produce or process the respective data, thereby increasing the quality of research findings {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-Wilkinson2016}{54}{]}.
Following this logic, after the curation of causal molecular interactions from scientific literature has been achieved, the next step is to store this information to a standard data format.
One of the most detailed, community-standard formats for representing molecular interaction data is the PSI molecular interaction (MI) XML format, released by the Human Proteome Organization Proteomics Standards Initiative (HUPO-PSI) {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-Hermjakob2004}{57}{]}.
The newest version of this standard is the PSI-MI XML 3.0 {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-Sivade2018}{58}{]}.
A simplified format for interaction data was provided by the same organization, called the Molecular Interaction Tabular format (PSI-MITAB).
PSI-MITAB has become popular amongst the scientific community since it is more user-friendly and Microsoft Excel-compatible, compared to the respective XML-based format {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-Kerrien2007}{59}{]}.
PSI-MITAB version 2.7 in particular, encapsulated many details of interest regarding a molecular interaction in a total of 42 columns, but it did not include information about its causality.
This resulted in an effort to standardize the signaling information and subsequent vocabulary terminology for causal molecular interactions, originally led by SIGNOR's database curators {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-Licata2019}{60}{]}.
The new PSI-MITAB version 2.8 (also called \textbf{CausalTAB}), included four new columns to incorporate additional details related to a molecular interaction's directionality (defining the biological roles of the regulator and target, one column each), regulatory mechanism (e.g.~indirect causal regulation or post-translational modification) and resulting effect (up or down regulation of the target) {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-Perfetto2019}{7}{]}.

After having a signaling data format for molecular interactions in place, the next challenge was to find a way to share such information efficiently.
The heart of the problem was the same even without the addition of causality information: a large number of molecular interaction databases exist, each one with different APIs to access the respective data.
Since no single database can incorporate the totality of molecular interactions pertaining to a specific biological system of interest, users have to collect data from diverse databases by launching queries in different websites or by directly downloading the respective files, which might not always be offered in standardized formats.
To ease the computational access and retrieval of molecular interaction data from various resources, a web service with a common query interface (PSICQUIC) and language (MIQL) was developed {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-Aranda2011}{61}{]}.
Using the PSICQUIC web service, users can now download all relevant data files from their databases of interest in different PSI-MI compliant formats, suitable for further analysis (Figure \ref{fig:fig4}).



\newpage

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{img/psicquic} \caption{PSICQUIC architecture. Molecular interaction knowledge about a biological system, supported by different experimental methods, is being reported in publications. Each of these publications reports part of the actual truth about the studied system. This knowledge is curated from the respective publications and inserted to diverse molecular interaction databases. The databases share their data in standard formats (e.g.~PSI-MITAB) via the PSICQUIC web service and are part of a registry list. Users launch queries via a PSICQUIC web client to retrieve the distributed molecular interaction data and synthesize the complete observed knowledge of the studied system, suitable for further analysis and visualization.}\label{fig:fig4}
\end{figure}

With a new signaling data format established by the relevant scientific community and the PSICQUIC web service contributing to the accessibility of molecular interaction data, the next step was to support the PSI-MITAB 2.8 format in PSICQUIC.
A software project to extend the PSICQUIC platform and include causality information of molecular interactions was thus formed.\footnote{This project was funded by the GREEKC (Gene Regulation Ensemble Effort for the Knowledge Commons) COST action (\url{https://www.greekc.org/}) and was realized as a Short Term Scientific Mission (STSM) in cooperation with engineers from the IntAct team at the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI).}
Our contribution to this effort was the development of the underlying PSICQUIC software (version 1.4) that indexes CausalTAB files provided by the respective data providers, enabling the query and subsequent download of causality-enriched interactions.
The PSICQUIC View website source code was updated to show the four new columns in the HTML table results.
Additionally, several clients that enable programmatic access to the distributed signaling data (written in Java, Python and Perl programming languages), were refactored to comply with data fitting the new standard format.
Lastly, the relevant PSICQUIC documentation was improved and reformatted to enhance user readability {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-mitab28-doc}{62}{]}.

The aforementioned development effort spurred a series of actions that led to several improvements in the PSICQUIC platform.
The Molecular Interactions Community, is an open source community providing tools, standard formats, ontologies and modules for manipulating molecular interaction data {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-mi-github}{63}{]}.
For example, some of these modules are used to read and write PSI-MITAB files across different versions.
Since these modules hadn't been updated for years (showing signs of software rot {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-wiki-soft-rot}{64}{]}), we had to refactor the codebase and add tests to ensure it's future reliability and quality.
In the end, even though we managed to complete the task and support CausalTAB in PSICQUIC via updating these modules, the need to replace them with a newer library was imminent.
JAMI is such a library, integrating all standard molecular interaction data formats such as the PSI-MI XML and PSI-MITAB, into a unified implementation, hiding the complex details of each format from the developers and thereby making their work easier {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-Sivade2018a}{65}{]}.
The implementation work was initiated in a GREEKC workshop {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-Hinxton2018}{66}{]} and continued during the first ELIXIR BioHackathon in Paris {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-biohack2018}{67}{]}.
Upon finishing the support for CausalTAB in JAMI,\footnote{During the GREEKC Marseille Hackathon 2019 event, see more info on the project here: \url{https://github.com/GREEKC/hackathon-marseille/tree/master/project_descriptions/causal_psicquic}} we provided the first PSICQUIC service indexing SIGNOR's CausalTAB data at the time, made available through a development server {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-psicquic-causalTAB-dataset}{68}{]}.

During the ELIXIR BioHackathon, the architecture details of a new cloud-based, distributed PSICQUIC service were discussed and documented for future development efforts.
The goal is to enable the data providers to upload their molecular interaction data in a fully automated process and add support for data validation.
This service will minimize the long-term commitment and maintenance from the data providers, which they cannot always afford (e.g.~deployment of the server hosting PSICQUIC).
Another outcome of the BioHackathon was the draft implementation of a new PSICQUIC View interface, aiming to modernize and update the current web application used to access PSICQUIC {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-psicquic-view}{69}{]}.
Further work needs to be done to import and use newer technologies in the interface, which will result in better filtering and sorting of the HTML table results and more interactive, graph-based visualizations of the PSICQUIC data.
To broadly facilitate the sharing of causal interaction data, additional development efforts are needed, in particular towards improving existing PSICQUIC clients.
One such example is the PSICQUIC Universal Client, a Cytoscape app for querying multiple PSICQUIC-compliant interaction data services from a simple user interface {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-PSICQUICUniversalClient}{70}{]}.
This client has been used in tutorials to guide novice users in the visualization and analysis of molecular interaction networks {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-Millan2013}{71}{]}.
Lastly, two more clients that need to be updated to support the latest CausalTAB signaling format are the PSICQUIC {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-Shannon2020}{72}{]} and PItools \texttt{R} packages {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-Kleshchevnikov2021}{73}{]}.
These packages enable the translation of molecular interaction data directly into formats suitable for computational analysis with \texttt{R}, and therefore are crucial for relevant computational tasks.

\section*{Biological modeling: a Prelude}\label{biological-modeling-a-prelude}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Biological modeling: a Prelude}

\indent

In previous chapters we summarized our efforts related to the curation, access and sharing of causal molecular interactions, the building block of PKNs.
This is only the first step in the process of creating computational models of biological systems {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-Wang2012}{74}{]}.
To translate signaling networks to a computational form for simulation purposes, the next step is to define the regulatory \emph{rules} (\emph{parameterization}) of the underlying system: how do the different network entities influence each other across time and potentially space, and how does the systemic behavior change when specific rules or parameters of the model are modified? {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-Aldridge2006}{75}{]}
The formulation of the rules in mathematical terms (i.e.~they are in most cases expressed as equations), defines the mechanistic details of the studied models and thus enables the study of their dynamics.
Practically, this means that models can be used for various forms of analyses and simulations, and their outputs further investigated.
For example, models can be validated and tested for agreement with experimental observations, can make predictions and generate new hypotheses leading to the design of new experiments, and they can be subjected to various perturbations, with their subsequent effects on the studied systems quantified and thoroughly analyzed.
In addition to the biological analysis, one of the more important aspects of mathematical modeling is that it enables the investigation of the underlying mechanisms that result in the manifestation of the described system's behavior.
In other words, computational models are explainable and interpretable, enabling us to answer why things happen the way they do, which is one of the driving forces behind science itself.

Several mathematical methodologies have been used to study biological systems, such as stochastic modeling, ordinary and partial differential equations (ODE and PDE modeling), Petri nets, logical modeling, Bayesian networks, cellular automata and agent-based modeling {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-ElKalaawy2015}{76}{]}.
Each modeling paradigm encapsulates a different way of formalizing the underlying rules and makes different assumptions about the studied system.
Such assumptions can for example include the temporal and spatial properties of the modeled system (space and time can each be treated in a continuous manner or with varying degrees of discretization), the molecular scale (focus on modeling individual molecules or discrete amounts of each molecule or just considering their molar concentrations) and the nature of interactions between the molecules (reaction processes can be described as happening in a stochastic or deterministic manner).
In general, there is a trade-off between the complexity of the system that a model is constructed to simulate and the mechanistic detail incorporated in the model itself {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-Aldridge2006}{75}{]}.
Ideally we would like to have models which can simulate highly complex systems in as much detail as possible.
This poses a significant challenge, since a more detailed representation of a biological system requires a higher level of granularity inherent in a model's formalization.
This means that more parameters are required to specify and calibrate the model for the simulation and accurate representation of reality, and larger amounts of experimental data and computational resources are also necessary.
On the other hand, by sacrificing the complexity of the studied system and making simpler models, we face overwhelming uncertainties that need to be properly quantified and integrated in any interpretation of results from such a model {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-Groen2021}{77}{]}.
In the end, the modeling scope is a crucial factor for the choice of the appropriate methodology, and thus sufficient knowledge of the advantages and disadvantages of each formalism can be beneficial towards selecting the approach deemed most suitable for the realization of the modeling objectives.

In this thesis we focus on Boolean modeling, one of the simplest formalizations for the modeling of complex biological systems {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-Schwab2020}{78}{]}.
In this type of qualitative approach, every individual entity has a binary state denoting activity (1) or inactivity (0) and time is discretized {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-Kauffman1969}{79}{]}.
Every interaction that affects a target entity is assembled into a Boolean equation which defines that particular target's output activity in the next time step.
To formulate such a Boolean equation, only knowledge of the regulatory network topology is needed, along with the use of logical operators that describe how the combined activity of the regulators affects the target.
This inherent simplicity in defining the rules is what makes the Boolean formalism attractive to modelers.
Moreover, since the PKN is one of the core elements that characterize the Boolean rules, this explains why we spent a large amount of our efforts in this thesis to make sure modelers get the proper contextual prior knowledge.
Lastly, another advantage of Boolean modeling is that it does not require the specification of parameters such as kinetic rate constants and initial concentrations that are a strong prerequisite in other modeling formalisms (e.g.~in ODE modeling), where there is always a need for large and expensive amounts of data that might be either lacking or not enough to adequately characterize the rules.

Continuing with the explanation of the modeling formalism, a logical model is a list of mathematical equations expressed in Boolean algebra.
The state of such a system is represented by a series of 0's and 1's, each corresponding to the activity state of a signaling entity.
Using the Boolean rules, we can update the system's state by deciding on the order that each of its equations are applied, to derive the next entity states.
Therefore, a synchronous update scheme can be defined as calculating the output of all Boolean equations of the model at the same time.
In contrast, randomly specifying one or more equations to update can result in various forms of asynchronous dynamics, which enable the inclusion of processes with different time scales in a logical model.
By repeatedly applying the Boolean rules, systemic states that either don't change (\emph{fixpoints}) or ones that demonstrate cycling patterns, can be reached.
These are the \emph{attractors}, which represent solutions to the system of equations that constitute a Boolean model and their identification is synonymous to the study of the long-term dynamical behavior of the modeled system.
Attractors have been shown to be biologically meaningful, either by representing specific phenotypic outputs {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-Kauffman1993}{80}{]} or transitions between system states like in the cell cycle {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-Faure2006}{81}{]}.

Several computational tools have been developed to aid in the dynamical analysis of Boolean models {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-Abou-Jaoude2016}{82}{]}.
These tools enable users to easily create and edit logical models, identify different types of attractors and their reachability properties, analyze model state evolution over time, investigate phenotypic outputs subject to various types of perturbations, explore different model parameterizations and calibrate models to fit experimental data, among others {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-Naldi2018a}{83}{]}.
The existence of such a plethora of tools has enabled the modeling of complex diseases, the discovery of potential therapeutic solutions and the investigation of biomarkers that correlate with patients' response to specific pharmaceutical drugs.
In particular, the derivation of mechanistic insights related to the manifestation of diseases, is one of the main challenges that computational modeling efforts strive to address towards achieving the goal of personalized medicine {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-Hood2011}{84}{]}.
In light of this, several logical modeling approaches have been used to stratify patients based on the integration of multi-omics data {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-Beal2018}{85}{]}, build patient-specific models that aid in the understanding of drug sensitivity and cancer resistance mechanisms {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-Eduati2017}{86}--\protect\hyperlink{ref-Tognetti2021}{88}{]} and help identify novel therapeutic targets {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-Saadatpour2011}{89}--\protect\hyperlink{ref-Eduati2020}{91}{]}.
Part of the work in this thesis has been to complement the aforementioned approaches by developing a software pipeline that uses causal prior knowledge and tailors Boolean models to cell-specific cancer signaling activities (\textbf{\protect\hyperlink{Paper3}{Paper 3}}).
These models can subsequently be used to predict combinatorial treatments that aid in the prioritization of drugs in high-throughput screening technologies and will eventually provide better clinical decision support for cancer patients, helping us find optimal drug-patient matches.

Our main goal is to use causal molecular knowledge and signaling activity data to build and parameterize Boolean models to represent specific cancer cell systems, and study their behavior in the presence of in-silico drug perturbations.
As such, the importance of the underlying scientific software that enables these computational tasks, is unquestionable.
Such software needs to satisfy a list of requirements pertaining to its suitability for practical use {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-Wilson2014}{92}{]}.
Such practices ensure that the software does what it is intended to do and its produced scientific simulations can be used to inform decision-making for clinical applications.
In other words, for the scientific results of the simulations to be \emph{actionable} and \emph{trustworthy} {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-Coveney2021}{93}{]}, the following software requirements are not just optional, but rather a necessity.
At first, challenges related to automation, efficiency and optimization in terms of the computational resources needed to perform the simulations and analyses, need to be properly addressed.
To promote collaboration and allow others to study, use and further develop the software, the respective codebase needs to be open sourced {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-Barnes2010}{94},\protect\hyperlink{ref-Prlic2012}{95}{]}.
Standard formats for input and output should be supported, as well standard libraries for common programming tasks, enabling the effortless integration with related software.
Also, sufficient documentation needs to be provided, containing installation guidelines and explanations for the various configurations used in the simulations {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-Karimzadeh2018}{96}{]}.
Simple examples of use and related tutorials should be part of such documentation as well {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-List2017}{97}{]}.
The usability of the software can also be increased by applying better programming architecture and design principles (e.g.~writing modular code), which also makes the software easier to test, extend and verify.
Making the results of the simulations verifiable (i.e.~by ensuring that the algorithmic procedures and the model equations are \protect\hyperlink{gtrr}{right}), will increase their reproducibility, further supporting the aforementioned goals {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-Sandve2013}{98}{]}.
All in all, there can only be gains if the code is \emph{clean} and properly taken care of {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-Martin2009}{99}{]}.

In Figure \ref{fig:fig5} we present an overview diagram of the DrugLogics software pipeline.
This pipeline represents a computational software system aiming to assist in the identification of synergistic drug combinations.
The pipeline's two main modules, Gitsbe and Drabme, are both written in Java.
Gitsbe, using as input a PKN and a signaling activity profile for some of the key entities in the input network, creates Boolean models based on a genetic algorithm approach and calibrates them to best fit the training signaling activity data.
Boolean models with higher fitness have fixpoint attractors, whose node states best match the binary signaling activities.
Calibration refers to changes in the Boolean equations to produce such high fitness models.
These changes can simply be variations in the parameterization such as mutations in the Boolean rules (e.g.~a logical OR becomes a logical AND and vice-versa) or topological changes, such as the addition or removal of a regulator's effect on a particular target.
Thus the Boolean models in Gitsbe's produced ensemble are parameterized differently, but are all essentially approximate representations of the same biological system.
These variant Boolean models are then used as input to Drabme, to test the effect of several perturbations from a given drug panel and quantify their combinatorial interaction patterns using well-known synergy frameworks (namely HSA {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-gaddum1940pharmacology}{100}{]} and Bliss {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-Bliss1939}{101}{]}).
Leveraging the wisdom of the crowds {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-Saez-Rodriguez2016}{102}{]} using Gitsbe's models, Drabme's output predictions contribute in reducing the exponentially large drug space that is associated with combinatorial treatments for the targeted therapy of cancer, providing a list of candidate combinations to test in the lab, before a viable solution is found for a patient.

\end{figure}

The development of Drabme and Gitsbe was part of the latest stages of a previous research thesis and it was mostly exploratory work {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-Flobak2016}{103}{]}.
To lay the groundwork for the analyses and investigations of the papers included in this thesis, additional software development needed to be done.
We started by refactoring the source code to increase its readability, maintainability and extensibility.
Java classes were restructured, variables and functions were renamed to reflect current best programming practices, code written from scratch for common tasks such as string manipulation was replaced with reusable Java components (e.g.~using libraries from Apache Commons {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-ApacheCommons}{104}{]}) and the Maven project management tool {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-Maven}{105}{]} was used to enable easier source compilation, installation and packaging (all the Java code was bundled in a single compressed file for ease of use).
To increase interoperability of our software, we used the Java library BioLQM {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-Naldi2018}{106}{]} to enable the export of the produced Gitsbe models to standardized formats in the logical modeling community, such as GINML (used in the GINsim software {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-Naldi2018b}{107}{]}), SBML-qual {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-Chaouiya2013}{108}{]} and BoolNet {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-Mussel2010}{109}{]}.
For the calculation of fixpoint attractors, an external scripting-based tool was used by default {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-Veliz-Cuba2014}{110}{]}.
We added a built-in, integrated Java solution using BioLQM, which apart from fixpoints can also identify minimal trapspaces, a generic type of attractor that allows for a deeper exploration of dynamics.

\newpage

A practical outcome of these efforts was that the code became more modular, enabling the addition of software tests using the JUnit5 framework {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-JUnit5}{111}{]} and specialized libraries {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-AssertJ}{112},\protect\hyperlink{ref-Mockito-site}{113}{]}.
With more tests, hidden or otherwise impossible to pinpoint bugs, were identified and fixed.
Some of these were critical for the validity of the output findings, since they related to how changes in the parameterization or topology were encoded in the software equivalent of a Boolean model's equations.
Moreover, it became much easier to add new features to the software, e.g.~we supported the execution of parallel simulations in Gitsbe (a significant performance optimization) and incorporated a new synergy framework for the identification of synergistic drug combinations in Drabme (Bliss).
Gitsbe's simulation is the core computational process that produces the ``best-fit'' models resulting from the evolutionary approach of the genetic algorithms.
Selecting a few of those best-fit models at the end of each simulation and executing multiple simulations in parallel, each one associated with a different random seed number, is what generates a reproducible list of Boolean models for use in Drabme (or other software if models are exported to standard formats).
Lastly, we shared publicly the developed modules in GitHub\footnote{See respective repositories \protect\hyperlink{druglogics-soft-links}{here}} and built an extensive online documentation using the \texttt{R} package \texttt{bookdown} {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-Xie2016}{114}{]} to gather all related information in one place with regard to the software's configuration parameters, the mathematical calculations used, installation instructions and examples of use.\footnote{See documentation repositories \protect\hyperlink{doc-links}{here}}
This online documentation became a central virtual hub, providing information on all the software modules in the pipeline.
One of these modules was \texttt{druglogics-synergy}, a convenient Java package used to serially execute Gitsbe and Drabme in one go, and which was employed for the simulations of \textbf{\protect\hyperlink{Paper3}{Paper 3}}.

With all the main code in proper order, we could start investigating the outputs of our software and assess the performance of the produced drug synergy predictions.
The results of these efforts, along with biologically-relevant mechanistic insights derived from further analyzing the simulation data and performing various investigations, are analytically presented in \textbf{\protect\hyperlink{Paper3}{Paper 3}}, and in even more detail at the \texttt{ags-paper} \protect\hyperlink{misc-links}{repository}, which also includes reproducibility guidelines.
In the following paragraphs we are going to briefly explain the input data and software that either needed to be in place before we started the experimentation with the in-silico simulations or was built to help further analyze the output Boolean models from Gitsbe and Drabme's synergy predictions.

To begin with, we had to choose a reference drug combination dataset to compare our predictions against.
The argument here is to use a dataset that you know very well so that you can first experiment with the software and its configurations, and only later test your predictions on other published (and potentially larger) datasets.
Therefore, we chose the Flobak et al.~(2019) dataset, with a total of 153 combinations of 18 targeted drugs, involving measurements across 8 cancer cell lines {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-Flobak2019}{115}{]}.
Next, we needed to assess in a computational manner which of the drug combinations in the reference dataset (per cell line) are synergistic and which are not.
Our first attempt was to manually check the output growth curves and derive a majority-assessed \emph{gold standard} (so it was more of a curative group effort).
We continued by performing a thorough analysis using the CImbinator tool {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-Flobak2017}{116}{]} and established a methodology which computed the synergy classification of the reference dataset that best matched our internal curation efforts to call synergy (see \texttt{sintef-obs-synergies} \protect\hyperlink{misc-links}{repository}).
All in all, we had a reference dataset and a list of drug combinations designated as synergistic from it, ready to be used to evaluate Drabme's predictions on the same dataset.

On another front, we also needed a PKN suitable for our analysis.
In particular, the targets of the drugs used in the reference dataset should be entities in the network, so as to enable the simulation of drug perturbations in Gitsbe's derived Boolean models.
Moreover, several of the most important pathways in cancer cell biology (e.g.~PI3K, ERK and TGFB signaling {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-kegg-cancer}{117}{]}) would have to be included as well.
A PKN that fits all the above characteristics was curated within our research group and refined throughout many years, resulting in the topology that was used for the simulations of \textbf{\protect\hyperlink{Paper3}{Paper 3}} (named \protect\hyperlink{misc-links}{CASCADE}).
In addition, proper signaling data was needed to train the Gitsbe models to a cancer proliferating phenotype.
For that purpose, we used the literature curated activity profile for a set of nodes in CASCADE, which was the result of a previous research work {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-Flobak2015}{90}{]}.
This activity profile concerns only one of the cell lines in the reference dataset, namely the gastric adenocarcinoma cell line (AGS).
In summation, by employing a curated topology and training data from only one cell line, we could focus more on the model parameterization aspects of our software, the performance assessment of the synergy predictions and the rest of the investigations of \textbf{\protect\hyperlink{Paper3}{Paper 3}}.

While exploring various configuration options for the Gitsbe and Drabme simulations,\footnote{See the DrugLogics software documentation \protect\hyperlink{doc-links}{here}} we needed a tool to quickly assess their effect on the pipeline's performance and see which were the most important to tune.
The pipeline's performance here refers to Drabme's output synergy predictions (continuous scores, each one for a different drug combination, ranging from negative and more synergistic values, to positive and more antagonistic values), validated against the computationally derived set of synergistic drug combinations for the AGS cell line (gold standard).
This is a classical binary classification problem, where an imaginary threshold scans the range of Drabme's predicted synergy scores to derive various performance scores.
Specifically, each threshold demarcates the synergistic drug combinations from the antagonistic ones, based on the output prediction scores.
By comparing these assessments with what we consider as the actual truth, i.e.~the gold standard synergy set, a confusion matrix can be constructed and several threshold-specific measures calculated (Figure \ref{fig:fig6}).
By accounting for every such threshold, ranging from a very strict (every prediction is declared as antagonistic) to a very relaxed one (every prediction is declared as synergistic), we can visualize Drabme's classifier performance with the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-Fawcett2006}{118}{]} and Precision Recall (PR) {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-Saito2015}{119}{]} curves, which are both well-known diagnostic tools for binary classification problems.
In particular, they allow for a more broad, threshold-agnostic performance measurement, which is the Area Under the Curve (AUC).
An AUC score of 1 is considered as the perfect classification, which in our case would happen if the top most negative synergy scores were exactly the ones corresponding to the drug combinations that represent the gold standard set for the AGS cell line.
The aforementioned diagnostic curves also enable the calculation of ``optimal'' cutpoints, e.g.~thresholds that maximize or minimize certain criteria, an example of the latter being the distance from the point of perfect classification {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-Perkins2006}{120}{]}.
Based on this theoretical framework, we developed the \texttt{R} shiny app {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-Chang2021}{121}{]} \texttt{druglogics-roc} to automatically parse Drabme's output files and produce a table {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-Xie2021}{122}{]} with the confusion matrix values per synergy threshold, along with interactive plots of the ROC (using the \texttt{R} package \texttt{plotly} {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-Sievert2020}{123}{]}) and PR curves (using the \texttt{R} package \texttt{PRROC} {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-Grau2015}{124}{]}) and their respective AUC scores.
This app is now part of the DrugLogics \protect\hyperlink{druglogics-soft-links}{software ecosystem}, facilitating the visualization of the pipeline's performance.

\caption{\label{fig:fig6}Performance assessment of Drabme's drug synergy predictions. Predicted synergy scores are sorted from synergistic to antagonistic and compared to a gold standard synergy set for several possible thresholds. Each synergy threshold can be used to construct a confusion matrix, from which standard metrics are calculated, such as the number of True Positive (TP) and False Positive (FP) predictions, precision and recall, etc. Visualizing several of these metrics across all thresholds in the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) and Precision Recall (PR) curves, enables the calculation of the Area Under the Curve (AUC), which is a performance score indicating how good the synergy classification method is.}
\end{figure}

The Boolean model ensembles produced by Gitsbe were a unique source for further data analyses.
Since these ensembles contain a large variety of models, we were motivated to investigate their model-specific differences in terms of activity output and parameterization, as well how these differences translate to variations in prediction performance, i.e.~make some models predict specific drug combinations as synergistic or not.
By assigning Gitsbe models into different classes based on their individual prediction performance, we could identify from dynamical analysis (i.e.~the models' attractors) nodes that were relatively more active (or inhibited) in the upper tier models compared to the lower tier models of the performance hierarchy.
For example, we verified across many analyses\footnote{See repository \texttt{gitsbe-model-analysis} \protect\hyperlink{misc-links}{here}} that the ERK node of the CASCADE signaling network was particularly active in the models that predicted most of the gold standard synergies in the AGS cell line from the reference drug combination dataset.
This was an interesting finding, since knowledge gathered from the scientific literature indicates conflicting measurements of ERK activity in AGS cells {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-Flobak2015}{90}{]} and so our modeling results, upon further analysis, have the potential of providing us with information related to important biomarkers (this particular result is also shown using a different methodology in \textbf{\protect\hyperlink{Paper3}{Paper 3}}).
In addition to the activity-based analyses, we also explored differences with respect to the Boolean model parameterization from Gitsbe's ensembles, e.g.~if higher performance models have specific logical operators or not and how these diverse parameterizations relate to the activity output in the different model classes (the latter also being one of the core motivations for the work presented in \textbf{\protect\hyperlink{Paper5}{Paper 5}}).
To enable all the aforementioned investigations, we began writing functions in several scripts while getting familiar with the world of professional software development in \texttt{R} {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-Wickham2015}{125}{]}.
In the end, we spent considerable effort to organize all these functions into a single, clean, modularized and tested codebase, with the purpose to fill in a niche for data analysis-oriented software that performs auxiliary automated analyses on Boolean model datasets.
The result was the creation of the emba \texttt{R} package and its addition to the DrugLogics software ecosystem (\textbf{\protect\hyperlink{Paper4}{Paper 4}}).
