Most important things achieved: Added tests to modules Gitsbe, Drabme usign JUnit5, mockito, assertJ libraries druglogics-roc-generator R shiny app Export support using BioLQM: the initial model + best generation models can now be exported through configuration options to GINML, SBML-Qual and BoolNet community formats 2.2 VSM VSM Dictionary Bioportal module 2.3 PSICQUIC miTab 2.8 support added to psicquic web service See psicquic doc here miTab 2.8/causalTab paper Update JAMI library to support miTab 2.8 - results of the BioHackathon 2018, Paris and the Marseille GREEKC hackathon event. 2.4 Others Java Client for RSAT tool fetch-sequences "],

This will change.1 3.1 Pipeline Ensemble Model biomarker analysis (part of this work is for automated pipeline paper). Roadmap: Make R package with general useful functions Make R package for biomarker analysis Make bookdown document for previous atopo-based analysis Redo the analysis on Cascade topology and for specific drug combinations (2) Feature importance/biomarker selection using ML methods (compare with what you got with your own method, submit to the ML course to get the credits) Submit R packages to CRAN Small publication of the R package and ML methods perhaps? Work on the pipeline modules (see the dev_plan_doc). Most important: Full Testing (Junit 5) BioLQM support: stable state calculation, trap spaces Do comparison between Aurelien’s BioLQM stable state algorithm and BNReduction using M2 3.2 VSM Make ontologies for genes and proteins known databases (Ensembl, Uniprot) PubDictionaries Dictionary Merger/Combiner 3.3 PSICQUIC Connect data taken from psicquic to atopo (enxtend atopo module to be PSICQUIC-compatible - takes causality information and builds network of interactions with available configuration on how to do so). Help build PSICQUIC 2.0 3.4 Synergy Augment existing R package for calculating reference models to include Wim’s generalized Bliss method and the mean synergy score by Simone Laderer! Goal is to test all the null reference models (Loewe, Bliss, ZIP, +2 new, others?) on read dose-response matrix datasets and see which is best at finding the synergies. R package to use: SynergyFinder from Finland group code here Also see this software: R package COMBIA Mathematical formulation of the volume-based synergy score general method to include (mine)?

["phd-ideas.html", "Chapter 4 PhD ideas 4.1 Compare fixpoint tools 4.2 Use Logical modeling to predict single-drug data 4.3 Quantum logic formalism 4.4 Harmony Search 4.5 Druglogics-Pipeline related", " Chapter 4 PhD ideas 4.1 Compare fixpoint tools Compare different tools that calculate fixpoints for logical modeling. Models used for testing could be of different types: self-contained varying the number of input nodes (1-n) small to large number of nodes small to large number of edges scale-free (boolnet generated) vs random (varying K connectivity) play with form of the boolean equations others ??? Other things that can be done: support BNReduction data format by Veliz-Cuba in BioLQM add support for calculating the fixpoints using the Colomoto docker (python interface) comparison between BioLQM, Pint, MABOSS and BNReduction could be done then in a Jupiter colomoto-enabled notebook! Further extension/comparisons could be: Tamura, 2009 - Integer programming method Dubrova, 2009 - SAT-based 4.2 Use Logical modeling to predict single-drug data Asmund project proposal: mechanistic drug response prediction analysis Automate drug target profile annotation from: Klaeger publication 2017 Science mrc ppu Davis publication 2011 (nature biotechnology?) Omics data (rna, cnv etc) COSMIC CCLE Drug scren data Single drug COSMIC/GDSC CCLE Combo O’Neil 2016 Molecular cancer therapeutics FDA Holbeck 2017 cancer research publication My idea is more like this: Predict drug-response curves from drug combination datasets (GDSC, CCLE), using logical modeling for singaling network analysis or translation from logical to ODE modeling. Aslo try to predict drug combinations datasets (dose-response matrices?). Pretty much what is done in this paper with help from this one for converting boolean models to continuous. 4.3 Quantum logic formalism Instead of logical modeling formalism, use the idea of (queantum) logical gates. The core idea makes sense: you don’t know the state of a protein, but when you measure it, only then you really know what it is. May also be worth to look at a game-theoritic approach to find attractors and such. 4.4 Harmony Search Use this algorithm for optimizing the boolean equations for gitsbe? 4.5 Druglogics-Pipeline related 4.5.1 Train models to cell-specific proliferation Concept is that random models predict a lot better than cell-specific ones: main directive is proliferation, not just fitting to a steady state pattern. 4.5.2 A bottom-up model building for drug prediction Start with a model and some observed synergies. Build/train/produce models that predict the first observed synergy (using Harmony Search?), from them the next one, etc. You end up with many models that can predict all the observed synergies or you try to find out why that cannot happen for example (e.g.  contrasting synergies?). Do the latest models’ stable states or attractors correspond to activity of proteins from literature? 4.5.3 Simulate cancer resistance For example, you have some models that predict some (observed) synergies or you just find some synergistic drug comibnations for these models or per model. Then, you modify these models in order to be resistant to these drugs, simulating thus the cancer rewiring process! Then, you apply (n+1) drug combinations to win over the resistance (and you do this procedure at more levels to suggest 3-way, 4-way drug combos and why there might be cancer models that can ‘win’ over these models and continue the proliferation). You end up with super cancer resistant models and methods to achieve them or reasons why this cannot happen at all. "],
