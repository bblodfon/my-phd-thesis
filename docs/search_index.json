["work.html", "Chapter 1 PhD work 1.1 Pipeline 1.2 VSM 1.3 PSICQUIC 1.4 Others", " Chapter 1 PhD work This is a summary of all the work that I have done in my PhD until now. (mainly it’s about software implementations related to the core technologies within the group). To include in the thesis text. Note though that not all of these will be part of the main thesis (maybe include the rest in a section like ‘Funny PhD side-quests’). 1.1 Pipeline Lots of refactoring to increase the readability, maintainability and extendability of the source code (complete restructure of classes, addition of others). This has RRI extensions, because cleaning and re-structuring software code has a social aspect to it in the sense that other people can now contribute more easily, extend the code, use it (user perspective can bring changes and further improvements to software pipeline even though they may be used for research purposes) - how can you expect users to actually use a piece of code when it’s not substantially documented and it’s internal logics made obscure because nobody gave attention to detail and structure? How can anybody care for a (software and any) product that you have not cared enough so as to present it in an way that is acceptable, managable and proper? Bug fixing Enable maven packaging for easier source compilation, testing, installation, management and executing of the code Added tests to modules gitsbe and drabme using JUnit5, mockito and assertJ libraries Source code documentation + proper README files on gitsbe, drabme and druglogics-synergy modules Enabling parallel simulations in Gitsbe Added support for many features (ongoing work - see dev_plan_doc) druglogics-roc-generator: R shiny app to assess the performance of the Drabme results in the form of a ROC curve Export support using BioLQM: the initial model + best generation models can now be exported through configuration options to GINML, SBML-Qual and BoolNet community formats 1.2 VSM Building VSM-dictionaries in order to connect/translate the data from various databases and ontology providers to proper VSM-terms. Most of this work is done in order to support Vasundra’s causalBuilder Tool which is the first application of VSM after SciCura v1. The vsm-dictionaries (code +documentation) can be found on the VSM Github page. They translate to VSM-terms data from BioPortal, UniProt, Ensembl, EnsemblGenomes, RNACentral and ComplexPortal. We have also released the respective packages on npmjs. See for example the npm package for BioPortal. 1.3 PSICQUIC My work at the EBI with IntAct and Noemi Del Toro to extend the PSICQUIC web service to support the miTab 2.8 data format/standard. See the psicquic doc and the casualTab paper (Perfetto et al. 2019). I also worked with Noemi on the update of the JAMI library to also support miTab 2.8 - this is the culmination of results from the BioHackathon 2018, in Paris and the Marseille GREEKC hackathon event. 1.4 Others Java Client for RSAT tool fetch-sequences References "],
["plans.html", "Chapter 2 PhD Tasks and Plans 2.1 Programming Tasks TODO 2.2 Papers 2.3 Other Paper Ideas", " Chapter 2 PhD Tasks and Plans 2.1 Programming Tasks TODO Tasks that I have promised that I will do to different people within the group. These tasks enable other workflows/collaborations, etc. so they are very important to finish before I move on to other work. You see only what’s left of those: Pipeline (see the dev_plan_doc for what is left). Most important: Full BioLQM support: stable state calculation and trap spaces Do comparison between Aurelien’s BioLQM stable state algorithm and BNReduction using M2 or without (Asmund already says that it BNReductions is faster but it’s good to prove it once again) VSM Make the vsm-pub-dictionaries module 2.2 Papers Note that the titles and the details for each paper are liable to change though the core ideas behind should not. The papers dictate my future work for this PhD (and in that order!). Paper I: emba: an R package for ensemble boolean model biomarker analysis Authors John, Asmund Idea The idea here is to analyse the models produced by Gitsbe in order to find important nodes (biomarkers) responsible for either better performance (based on a metric score like TP or MCC) or for specific synergy(ies) prediction. The R package emba (Zobolas 2019) is publishable by itself as an application note paper, but we decided with Asmund that is best to present with an analysis on some dataset to show it’s use. The package is also used for analyses that will be included in Asmund’s automated pipeline paper (on the cascade topology mostly). An idea is to compare ML results with my method (on cascade/atopo results of the pipeline paper or other). Paper could be titled something along the lines of “Ensemble model analysis vs Machine Learning for unraveling drug synergy mechanisms”. (which depends only on me). Could also be that I combine Vasundra’s and Barbara’s computational work on the biomarker analysis with mine and the ML methods (so more generic even) to create a nice combo paper about “Unraveling drug mechanisms on CRC cell lines using various computational methods”. A research question here (with similar kind of work) is about the identification of optimal training data size, in the sense that we can use various methods to derive a node (biomarker) set for the training data (with Eirini). Paper II: VSM-dictionaries: common access to biological dictionaries Authors John, Steven, Vasundra, Martin Idea/Implementation A short application note paper for my work on VSM-dictionaries. Paper III: From causal statements to building logical models compliant with biological knowledge Authors John, others (to decide) Idea This paper will be the main research paper of my PhD. This idea is like a continuation of the causalBuilder tool by Vasundra coupled with the need to have a more proper representation of complexes (and families) in our logical models (better models, better predictions). Asmund had manually changed some logical equations in his paper (Flobak et al. 2015), in order to make the model more compliant with biology knowledge and literature findings. One of them was about the beta-catenin complex and its constituents (connected with AND’s instead of OR’s) and the rest were about changing the link operators of the logical equations (from AND NOT to OR NOT). The latter is something that is enabled through the mutations introduced by the genetic algorithm of Gitsbe. The former depends on the dataset and the representation of complexes.1 Only Signor has some complexes + interaction data but they are seperate files, making it thus difficult (and non-elegant computationally-wise) to integrate such knowledge/data to boolean models. Also Vasundra’s experience with Reactome data in miTab2.8 showed us the difficulty to match binary interactions to a data model flexible enough to represent complexes and their internal components. Causal-JSON and the recursive schema that we thought allows the curator to put both the complex ID and it’s constituents in the same data structure. And what’s best than using a proper tool to annotate such causal statements like VSM! Proposed Workflow So, the general semi-automated web-application (web only if VSM comes into play) pipeline for this paper that I am thinking will be as follows:2 Get interaction + complexes/families data (Signor most probably or a form of Cascade + complexes???). Note that for the reason I explained above miTab 2.8 is out of the question, so the Signor data I am refering to is the .tsv files they offer (interaction data, complexes, families). And most probably I am referring to a pathway interaction dataset not the whole Signor data. For example, the Wnt Signaling pathway. Build a small module that translates the (Signor) data to Causal-JSON. Optionally3 there can be support for (re-)curation of the data with VSM template(s) for proper annotation of complexes (the templates will be automatically pre-filled to match Signor’s data model). Note that this implies causal-JSON =&gt; VSM-box JSON format, which is the reverse of what causalBuilder will do. It will be nice if such interface supports addition of one more template of the same thing to curate one new sentence and add it to the data. The thing is that I want to include VSM into this, but I don’t yet know how to really support its place in this pipeline since the curation is already done from Signor. It can be part of a showcase though: an example causal statement from the pathway with a complex and how it could be cureated with VSM. Main: Build a package that translates the causal-JSON data to a logical model with some filtering and parameterization included (e.g. filter based on cell line (so cell-line specific topologies), conditions on the biological state: ‘by phoshorylation’, exp. evidence, assertion/confidence score, species, compartment). So, causal-JSON to .bnet files (logical equations), while substituting nicely4 the complexes and families. Showcase some small application of this logical model end-product: use for example the colomoto notebook, do some small trapspace analysis and show that some results from literature or from previous logical or other models can now be reproduced with a better biological representation in the model itself make many logical models of the pathways in Signor with simple attractor analysis and put them into the GinSim model repository for reference for the logical community. extend atopo module to use the main (3) package and use it for finding drug combinations (comparing attractors or prediction results of automated topology building without complexes vs automated topology built from causal-JSON with complexes and families in each case). The main thing here would be of course better prediction performance results based on a better logical model representation. I could tweak atopo to choose actually not all of Signor’s data but specific pathways to include in the analysis and this will help I believe to build smaller topologies for specific drug combinations that we want to test. Interesting resources: Signor Pathway data CausalBuilder CancerGeneNet 2.3 Other Paper Ideas Paper IV (Deprecated) Title Extending SynergyFinder for the use of multiple reference models for the assement of synergy in screening datasets Idea The core idea here is to extend an existing R package for calculating synergy reference models in order to include Wim’s generalized Bliss method and the mean synergy score by Simone Laderer! Then I will test all the null reference models (Loewe, Bliss, ZIP, +2 new, others?) on dose-response matrix datasets (could be from Ladere’s paper, from Asmund’s paper, our own - Barbara’s/Evelina’s dataset, etc.) and see which is best at finding the synergies in each dataset. R package to use: SynergyFinder from Finland group code here Also I have to check this software: R package COMBIA as well as others at the time I will be tackling this Also, I should investigate if my own idea for a mathematical formulation of the volume-based synergy score as general method for describing 3-wise or more combinations as synergistic, could be part of this implementation (or could be another paper by itself). Paper V (Why not?!) Authors John, others (to decide) Title On eye-balling synergy mechanisms: What is a mountain synergy? Idea I had the idea of writing a small paper (send to Science Signaling) that describes the eye-ball or visual inspection technique that is used so much in computational Biology and Medicine. It is used pretty much in any paper I have seen but nobody has actually defined or named it. A characteristic example is the call for synergy when you see some experimental data in dose-response curves (show mostly when you see figures). Another is the threshold that data analysts put when defining output to classifiers or the parameterization that is used and the general human intuition/engineering that is shared in all these. As Asmund once said: What is a mountain? What is a synergy? So, I just want to discuss this in a small paper cause it seems to be a thing that everybody is aware of in their everyday job, but everyone keeps out when talking about results, etc and I haven’t found a paper that discusses this one way or another! A very RRI-related paper… References "],
["ideas.html", "Chapter 3 PhD ideas 3.1 Quantum logic formalism 3.2 Compare fixpoint tools 3.3 Reasoning with VSM 3.4 Use Logical modeling to predict single-drug data 3.5 Druglogics-Pipeline related", " Chapter 3 PhD ideas Several ideas that I may do or not in my PhD but I still keep here for my future investigations! 3.1 Quantum logic formalism My favourite! Investigate if instead of a logical modeling formalism, the idea of (quantum) logical gates can be used to represent and analyse protein interaction networks. The core idea makes sense: you don’t know the state of a protein, but when you measure it, only then you really know what it is. May also be worth to look at a game-theoritic approach to find attractors and such. 3.2 Compare fixpoint tools Idea: Compare different tools that calculate fixpoints for logical modeling. Faster wins of course :) Models used for testing could be of different types: self-contained varying the number of input nodes (1-n) small to large number of nodes small to large number of edges scale-free (boolnet generated) vs random (varying K connectivity) play with form of the boolean equations others ??? Workflow for this includes: support BNReduction data format by Veliz-Cuba in BioLQM add support for calculating the fixpoints using the Colomoto docker (python interface) + BNReduction then comparison between BioLQM, Pint, MABOSS and BNReduction could be done then in a Jupiter colomoto-enabled notebook! Further extension/comparisons could be: (Akutsu, Hayashida, and Tamura 2009) - Integer programming method (Dubrova and Teslenko 2009) - SAT-based 3.3 Reasoning with VSM The idea here is to use VSM to annotate sentences about some knowledge area, store this information in a format like RDF or something else (graph database?) and then ask questions that will enable you to learn stuff that you didn’t know before. One goal would be to show the superiority of connection-based reasoning (humans and what VSM encapsulates) vs logic reasoning (OWL). Another thing I thought was to just translate the VSM-data to PROLOG and then ask questions using that logical language framework. It is a way to show that you learned something using the VSM-supported curation but I don’t know where to go from there… this whole knowledge semantics and reasoning stuff seem to be a PhD on its own :) There are a lot of things that should be investigated for this idea to materialize properly (lots of reading). An idea by Steven: Mapping / inferring different forms of representing interactions (molecular and/vs. causal) using a VSM sentence presentation as a graph diagram. A first step to reasoning would be to make some rules like, if you have VSM-sentences A and B, then you can infer C from that. 3.4 Use Logical modeling to predict single-drug data Asmund’s proposal idea that he sent to my email once. Has to do about mechanistic drug response prediction analysis: Automate drug target profile annotation from: (Klaeger et al. 2017) mrc ppu (Davis et al. 2011) Omics data (rna, cnv etc) COSMIC CCLE Drug screen data Single drug COSMIC/GDSC CCLE Combo (O’Neil et al. 2016) (Holbeck et al. 2017) My idea is more like this: Predict drug-response curves from drug combination datasets (GDSC, CCLE), using logical modeling for singaling network analysis or translation from logical to ODE modeling. Also try to predict drug combinations datasets (dose-response matrices?). Pretty much what is done in this paper (Fröhlich et al. 2018) with help from (Wittmann et al. 2009) for converting boolean models to continuous. 3.5 Druglogics-Pipeline related 3.5.1 Harmony Search Nice idea because it’s related to music! Investigate if this algorithm could be used for optimizing the boolean equations for gitsbe - thus opening the stage for JazzLogics. 3.5.2 Train models to cell-specific proliferation Concept is that training models to proliferate provides a wider variance of models than the cell-specific trained ones in gitsbe: main directive is proliferation, not just fitting to a steady state pattern. So a hybrid training approach should be way more advantageous. 3.5.3 A bottom-up model building for drug prediction Start with a model and some observed synergies. Build/train/produce models that predict the first observed synergy (using Harmony Search?), from them the next one, etc. You end up with many models that can predict all the observed synergies or you try to find out why that cannot happen for example (e.g.  contrasting synergies?). Do the latest models’ stable states or attractors correspond to activity of proteins from literature? 3.5.4 Simulate cancer resistance For example, you have some models that predict some (observed) synergies or you just find some synergistic drug comibnations for these models or per model. Then, you modify these models in order to be resistant to these drugs, simulating thus the cancer rewiring process! Then, you apply (n+1) drug combinations to win over the resistance (and you do this procedure at more levels to suggest 3-way, 4-way drug combos and why there might be cancer models that can ‘win’ over these models and continue the proliferation). You end up with super cancer resistant models and methods to achieve them or reasons why this cannot happen at all. References "],
