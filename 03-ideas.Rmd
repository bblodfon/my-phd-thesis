# (PART\*) Miscellaneous Stuff {-}

# PhD ideas {#ideas}

Several ideas that I may do or not in my PhD but I still keep here for my future
investigations!

## Quantum logic formalism {#quantum}

My favourite! Investigate if instead of a logical modeling formalism, the idea 
of (quantum) logical gates can be used to represent and analyse protein interaction
networks.
The **core idea** makes sense: you don't know the state of a protein, but when 
you measure it, only then you really know what it is.

May also be worth to look at a [game-theoritic approach](https://doi.org/10.1007/11885191_18)
to find attractors and such.

## Compare fixpoint tools {#comp}

Idea: Compare different tools that calculate fixpoints for logical modeling. 
Faster wins of course :)

Models used for testing could be of different types:

- self-contained
- varying the number of input nodes (1-n)
- small to large number of nodes
- small to large number of edges
- scale-free (boolnet generated) vs random (varying K connectivity)
- play with form of the boolean equations
- others ???

Workflow for this includes:

- support BNReduction data format by [Veliz-Cuba](https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2105-15-221) 
in BioLQM
- add support for calculating the fixpoints using the Colomoto docker (python
interface) + BNReduction
- then comparison between **BioLQM, Pint, MABOSS and BNReduction** could be done then
in a Jupiter colomoto-enabled notebook!

Further extension/comparisons could be:

- [@Akutsu2009] - Integer programming method
- [@Dubrova2009] - SAT-based

## Reasoning with VSM

The idea here is to use VSM to annotate sentences about some knowledge area, 
store this information in a format like RDF or something else (graph database?) 
and then ask questions that will enable you to learn stuff that you didn't know 
before. 

One goal would be to show the superiority of *connection-based reasoning*
(humans and what VSM encapsulates) vs *logic reasoning* (OWL).

Another thing I thought was to just translate the VSM-data to PROLOG
and then ask questions using that logical language framework. It is a way to show
that you *learned* something using the VSM-supported curation but I don't know 
where to go from there... this whole knowledge semantics and reasoning stuff 
seem to be a PhD on its own :) There are a lot of things that should
be investigated for this idea to materialize properly (lots of reading).

## Use Logical modeling to predict single-drug data

Asmund's proposal idea that he sent to my email once. Has to do about *mechanistic drug response prediction analysis*:

- Automate drug target profile annotation from:  
  - [@Klaeger2017]
  - [mrc ppu](http://www.kinase-screen.mrc.ac.uk/)
  - [@Davis2011]
- Omics data (rna, cnv etc) 
  - COSMIC
  - CCLE
- Drug screen data
  - Single drug
    - COSMIC/GDSC
    - CCLE
  - Combo
    - [@ONeil2016]
    - [@Holbeck2017]

**My idea** is more like this:  
Predict drug-response curves from drug combination datasets (GDSC, CCLE), 
using logical modeling for singaling network analysis or translation from 
logical to ODE modeling. Aslo try to predict drug combinations datasets 
(dose-response matrices?). Pretty much what is done in this paper [@Frohlich2018] 
with help from [@Wittmann2009] for converting boolean models to continuous.

## Druglogics-Pipeline related

### Harmony Search

Nice idea because it's related to music! 
Investigate if [this algorithm](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.proeng.2016.07.510) 
could be used for optimizing the boolean equations for `gitsbe` - thus opening the
stage for `JazzLogics`.

### Train models to cell-specific proliferation

Concept is that training models to proliferate provides a wider variance of models than the 
cell-specific trained ones in `gitsbe`: main directive is **proliferation**, 
not just fitting to a steady state pattern. So a hybrid training approach should
be way more advantageous.

### A bottom-up model building for drug prediction

Start with a model and some observed synergies. Build/train/produce models that
predict the first observed synergy (using Harmony Search?), from them the next
one, etc. You end up with many models that can predict all the observed 
synergies or you try to find out why that cannot happen for example (e.g. 
contrasting synergies?). Do the latest models' stable states or attractors 
correspond to activity of proteins from literature?

### Simulate cancer resistance

For example, you have some models that predict some (observed) synergies or you
just find some synergistic drug comibnations for these models or per model. 
Then, you modify these models in order to be resistant to these drugs, simulating
thus the cancer rewiring process! Then, you apply (n+1) drug combinations to
win over the resistance (and you do this procedure at more levels to suggest 
3-way, 4-way drug combos and why there might be cancer models that can 'win' 
over these models and continue the proliferation). You end up with super cancer
resistant models and methods to achieve them or reasons why this cannot happen
at all.
